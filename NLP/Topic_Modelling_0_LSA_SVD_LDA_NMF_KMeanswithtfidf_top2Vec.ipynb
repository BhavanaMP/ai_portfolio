    "### Why Topic Modelling?###\n",
    "\n",
    "Topic modeling is a frequently used approach to discover hidden semantic patterns portrayed by a **text corpus** and automatically **identify topics** and **draw conclusions** that exist inside it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Namely, it’s a type of statistical modeling that leverages **unsupervised machine learning** to analyze and **identify clusters or groups** of similar words within a body of text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eg: A topic modeling algorithm may be deployed to determine whether the contents of a document imply it’s an invoice, complaint, or contract.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "Topic Modelling can be done using **rules based** or **machine learnung based**\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Rules-Based Methods\n",
    "A simple approach to the identification of topics in a collection of documents is what we would call a rules-based approach. Here, we could argue that documents in which certain words appear indicate a specific topic. This manual approach may yield good results. For example, if I had a 100,000 documents and I knew that some dealt with medical details, I could look for a handful of terms, such as doctor, medicine, hospital, etc. to extract those documents as dealing with a topic of medical.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **key problem** with this approach is **scale**. We cannot practically construct lists like this for all possible topics, especially if we do not know the topics found within a corpus. Further, constructing lists like this requires detailed knowledge about a subject. For these reasons, a rules-based approach to classifying documents is not practical for large corpora.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Machine Learning-Based Methods\n",
    "Another option to identify topics in a text is via a machine learning-based approach. In this method, we do not give a computer system a set of rules, rather we let the computer generate its own rules to identify topics in a corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is done in two different ways:\n",
    "- supervised\n",
    "- unsupervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "In supervised learning, we know the key subjects in a corpus. We give a computer system a set of documents with their corresponding label to teach it to identify the characteristics that make that particular topic or class unique. This is mostly used for **text classification**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In unsupervised learning, we do not know the topics of our documents and, instead, we want let the system identify those topics and cluster (or group together) the ones of a high degree of similarity together. We then examine the words that occur the most frequently in each cluster to get a sense of the topics at hand.\n",

    "## Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA)\n",
    "\n",
    "LSA uses Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to reduce the dimensionality of a document-term matrix, highlighting the latent semantic relationships between words and documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Construct** the document–term matrix  \n",
    "   \\begin{equation}\n",
    "     X(DTM) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{D \\times V},\\quad X_{d,w} = \\text{count or TF‑IDF}\n",
    "   \\end{equation}\n",
    "   Once we have our document-term matrix X, which is very sparse, very noisy, and very redundant across its many dimensions. As a result, to find the few latent topics that capture the relationships among the words and documents, we want to perform dimensionality reduction on X. This dimensionality reduction can be performed using truncated SVD.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Truncated SVD** (rank \\(r\\)):  \n",
    "\n",
    "    In essence,  \n",
    "    SVD, or singular value decomposition, is a technique in linear algebra that factorizes any matrix M into the product of 3 separate matrices: $M=U \\times \\Sigma \\times V$, where (U) is a left singular vector matrix, $\\Sigma$ is a diagonal matrix containing singular values of M and (V) is a right singular vector matrix. Singular values are real, non-negative numbers derived from a matrix through a process called Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). Specifically, they are the square roots of the eigenvalues of the matrix $M^TM$ (or $MM^T$ for real matrices), where $M^T$ is the transpose of M. They represent the \"magnitude\" of the transformation associated with the matrix. These values, along with corresponding singular vectors, allow for a matrix to be decomposed into a product of three matrices, providing insights into its properties and structure.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Critically, truncated SVD reduces dimensionality by selecting only the t largest singular values, and only keeping the first t columns of U and V. In this case, t is a hyperparameter we can select and adjust to reflect the number of topics we want to find\n",
    "\n",
    "    \\begin{equation}\n",
    "     X = U\\,\\Sigma\\,V^\\top,\n",
    "     \\quad\n",
    "     U\\in\\mathbb{R}^{D\\times t},\\;\n",
    "     \\Sigma\\in\\mathbb{R}^{t\\times t},\\;\n",
    "     V\\in\\mathbb{R}^{V\\times t}.\n",
    "    \\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "   Intuitively, think of this as only keeping the t most significant dimensions in our transformed space.\n",
    "   In this case, $U \\in\\mathbb{R}^{(D \\times t)}$ emerges as our document-topic matrix, and $V \\in\\mathbb{R}^{(V \\times t)}$ becomes our term-topic matrix. In both U and V, the columns correspond to one of our t topics. In U, rows represent document vectors expressed in terms of topics; in V, rows represent term vectors expressed in terms of topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "    With these document vectors and term vectors, we can now easily apply measures such as cosine similarity to evaluate:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - the similarity of different documents\n",
    "    - the similarity of different words\n",
    "    - the similarity of terms (or “queries”) and documents (which becomes useful in information retrieval, when we want to retrieve passages most relevant to our search query).\n",

    "3. **Interpretation**  \n",

    "\n",
    "In linear algebra, an eigenvector of a matrix(matrix=group of vectors) is a non-zero vector that, when a linear transformation is applied to it, is scaled by a constant (the eigenvalue). This means the eigenvector's direction remains unchanged, and the eigenvalue indicates the amount by which the vector is stretched or shrunk.\n",

    "These are special vectors associated with a matrix that don't change direction when the matrix is applied to them. They are also called characteristic vectors.\n",

    "**Eigenvalues:**\n",
    "These are the scalar values that represent how much the eigenvector is stretched or shrunk after the linear transformation.\n",

    "**Linear Transformation:**\n",
    "In the context of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, a linear transformation is represented by a matrix, and it's a function that maps vectors to other vectors, often involving scaling and rotation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Equation:**\n",
    "The relationship between an eigenvector (v), its corresponding eigenvalue (λ), and the matrix (A) is expressed as: Av = λv. This equation states that when matrix A is applied to the eigenvector v, the result is the same as scaling v by the eigenvalue λ"

I was born as Naftali Salsitz and now my name is Norman Salsitz, but during the war I had a few different names.  I was raised in a small town. It's in southern Poland it's named Kolbuszowa, and this belonged to the minor Poland. We called it in Polish Mourpoliska. And before the first world war, it belonged to Alsea which was called Galicia. In 1920.  Well, we were a very large family. We were nine children, five sisters and four brothers. I was the youngest from the nine. My father was a Hasidic Jew, very religious, my mother...the whole family was very religious. He had a long grey beard and my mother was very religious. She wear a Sheitel, which means a wig. And everything was around Jewish tradition, Jewish religion. I attended when I was 3 years, I started heder, which means a school for boys. Til 3 years I had my hair. By 3 years, they cut off my hair, but they left side locks. And after this heder when I was 6 years, I attended a small Yeshiva. They called it Yeshiva for the young boys. I also started public school, regular public schools for which was together with the Polish boys. And when I was 15 years I was sent out to a Yeshiva to a very famous Rabbi in the town named Tarnow, a larger town and which my father was a disciple of this Rabbi. He was a follower, so he send me to his Yeshiva. And then when I came back...I wasn't there too long, because I wasn't very happy with it, I started to work in my father's business. And my father had a wholesale store in which we sold everything. Now the stores in the villages used to come to us and they bought the merchandise for their stores. So here you could call it a general store. We had there everything what was needed for a household, we sold it. And it was quite a prosperous business. Our town mostly, they were very poor Jews. I would say 50 percent were poor, and 40 percent made a living, and 10 percent were rich Jews. My father was considered to be among the 10 percent rich Jews. And this how we lived. It was a very close family. My sisters, when they were married, my father saw to it that they would remain in our town. He gave them a dowry. He bought them a house, and he established a business for them. What he used to do, he used to take a branch from our business and he gave it over to him and he took care of this on a wholesale level for this business. And this we lived quite happily til the war. My oldest brother went to America in 1919 one year before I was born because in 1919 we had the pogrom. The Poles came and they killed nine Jews, wounded 200, and this pogrom was for the celebration of gaining independence. So what is a better way to celebrate independence after so many years than to have a little pogrom. Not a big one, but at least nine people killed. So after this, my oldest brother left and he came to America. So he didn't know me because I was born a year later. In 1933, my second brother left. He became a Zionist which all family was always in. There were Hasidic, but they always were, all the sisters belong to Zionist organizations and even my father was enough up-to-date that he was a Zionist. And my brother left in 1933 as a Chalutz, as a pioneer in this time. So those brothers were out from our town, but the rest were living in our town til the war started. And it was a happy life. I was never satisfied with this life in this little stet] because I looked for something else. I wanted to go to school. I wanted to study. I wanted to go to gymnasium. My dream was to become a doctor, but I was too young and I was maybe too weak to say to my father, \\\"I want to take off this Hasidic clothing,\\\" which I always hated, \\\"and to be like everybody else, to be a modern man.\\u201d But it didn't come til a year before the war. I joined the Zionist organization which was the Hanoar Hatzioni. It was the young movement and I was very happy because this was the tie that gave me a chance to belong to organization together with girls, which before I couldn't speak to her. There was special one girl which I fell in love when I was 12 years old, and I had a chance to be with her together with our other friends, and this was quite a happy time for me that I could get out of this burden of what my father wanted me to be a Hasidic boy to sit in the temple, in the synagogue and to study from morning til night.  Well, then before the war we started to feel when the things happened to Germany, we felt it in Poland. We felt it because the climate started to be...the Poles started to show their anti- Semitism a little more openly. Til 1935 was not so bad because til 1935, Pilsudki was the marshall in Poland, and he was quite good for Jews. And the minute Pilsudski died, a lot of tihngs happened. It changed. Smidli took it over and then special laws came out against Jews. The businesses started to be bad for Jews. They opened cooperatives and slogans were all over and they used to say in Poland, [polish] [polish] means everybody to his own for his own. The small businesses lost everything because those cooperatives started small businesses in the villages. So what they did. peasants didn't sell their produce to Jews, so usually used to buy them, but they brought them to the cooperatives and they used to exchange them for merchandise they needed. So they cut out the Jew who bought the produce and they cut out the Jew who sold them their merchandise. But we, our family didn't suffer because they were not enough advanced to have wholesale places to supply the storekeepers in the villages. So even there were more storekeepers in the villages, our business improved because they had to come to us for this merchandise to sell to the peasants in the villages. So we didn't feel it. But my father always said that this is only for a time being because eventually they will be enough advanced to start their own wholesale stores and their own manufacturing, that they will cut out even the wholesale letting the manufacture which was mostly in Jewish hands. So we knew this is only...in a short time, our business will go down also. And then the climate was so bad that everything what happened in Germany from the papers we started to see, it started to happen in Poland. There was a time that they tried to forbid ritual slaughter for kosher meat which in the time of Pilsudski would never happen, but it happened, but the Jews fought back and it didn't come to be that the slaughters should be forbidden. Also, they organized ,they established a concentration camp on the system that it was in Germany in this time because in Germany even before the war, they had a few concentration camp, which starting with Dachau, Buchenwald. So they had in Poland, a concentration camp in Breizakotuska . This was in the northern part in Poland. And what they brought in mostly, supposedly to be for communists which were enemies of the state, but also Jews who they thought didn't do such business, they did something wrong. Instead to put them to jail or instead they give them fine, they brought them over to this concentration camp, which was a very notorious concentration camp. So all those things were prepared against the Jews. Like for instance, there was the Prime Minister. His name was Slatkovski ?. He was a general, so he even was a very famous expression, when there was a debate about Jews and people say the Jews have to go out of Poland, be thrown out of Poland, beaten up in Poland, so he said to beat up Jews no, but to destroy them economically he said ofshun. In Polish ofshun means by all means. So this was a very famous saying, ofshun, Prime Minister said that we have to do it. Now, for instance, the...  Alright. Well, this I give you just a feeling how the situation and this was so in this time, I decided that I have to leave Poland, that this Poland was not for me, so I had to leave. Now to leave Poland wasn't so easy because where would you go to? I wanted to go to Palestine because I became a Zionist and this was my dream. But to go to Palestine wasn't so easy. I was little too young, and then later you had to have a certificate from the English government and only a few got and a few were lucky in that. And so I decided to go illegal to Palestine. So in 1938, I joined a groups that we paid in money and we're supposed to be smuggled to Romania, and Romania to take a boat illegal to enter Palestine. So we had to pay 500 zlotys for it; 500 zlotys was quite a lot of money. I decided with a friend of mine, he was a very close friend. Now this boy didn't have the 500 zlotys, so I remember the day when the letter came that we should pay it in, I paid in my 500 zlotys, and he didn't have it. So his mother had two silver candlesticks, probably from her mother, so she went and she had to sell the two candlesticks and still he didn't have the 200...the 500 zlotys. He was short 200, so I remember I gave him the 200 zlotys, and he said he would pay it back to me in Palestine. And we paid in and we were prepared and we waited to go, but this never came to be and the war in the middle started and we supposed to go in August and the war started in September, the Ist of September. And this dream fell through. Also I wanted to come to America because I had here a brother, and all my father's brothers and sisters were here. My father was the only one who remained home. So I wrote them letters and I begged them to send me papers. But none of them sent me papers. Only what they had to do is to invest 25 cents to go to another Republic and send me affidavit. But they didn't do it. And when they didn't do it, so America was out. Palestine was out. So I had to stay there til the Germans came in. Now, Ist of September the war broke out. And it was a very bad feeling because we knew that this something terrible will happen. Everybody there were rumors that the Polish army is strong. We have a strong calvary, and they mobilized people, the older people. Now the Polish government, I don't know if they did it purposefully, if they had traitors there, because they mobilized old people. People who used to serve in the Austrian army in the first world war. The young people they didn't mobilize. And so I felt that my duty, I felt myself as a Polish patriot. I wanted to be part of Poland. I lived in Poland. So I went and I volunteered to the army soon as the war broke out. They didn't accept me because they said they don't have enough uniforms for the regular army. How would they take me? So my parents naturally didn't know that I went and I volunteered. The feeling was that something terrible will happen and we awaited it. Now the Ist of September, the war broke out right a day, 2, 3 days later. Thousands of refugee came through our town. And most refugee who fled from the western part of Poland came to us and the reason why they came to us is because we didn't have a railroad. And there was a short cut from Tarnow to cut through to the east, and usually when there was a railroad the Germans used to bomb the railroad and to shoot, so this way because there were fields so they used to go through this route, thousands and thousands, every day more and more. And then later you could see the army broken up, broken units, and they came through our town. And Saturday, the 9th of September, the Germans came in. And as we were never a lucky town, like we had a pogrom; we had other things always happen in our town. So Saturday morning the town was clear. There were no Polish soldiers, so we figured there would not be no battle and the Germans will come and take the town. So it happens at 12 o'clock, a new regiment came in that had run away and they said they're going to make a line in our town. And the Germans came in about 3 o'clock, and there was a battle and there were 65 Germans killed and about 200 Polish soldiers, and there were about 150 Jewish civilians. Why Jewish? They didn't kill when there was a battle picking out Jews, but the Jews were the refugees. They didn't know where to hide. They mostly were Jews, because Poles didn't run away. They were not so much afraid so they were caught in the middle in a strange town and they were killed. And the atrocities started right away. They took us out in a open place, and they burned half of the town. And we were in the middle and they came and they said that the battle, the fight was done by Jews, not by Polish soldiers, and for this reason they're going to burn alive all the Jews from our town. And they burned, they purposely started to burn the town, the houses around where we were located. And we saw that maybe they will do these things, which they did not at the time. But it so happened in the evening, somebody came and they said, \\\"No. They will let us go.\\u201d And they kept us for a whole night in the fields. The next day we came home, and all the houses were plundered, the houses which were not burned were plundered. The Germans stayed in there a half day. They went in and took out everything they wanted. And we started to live under German occupation.  When I was watching where we were in this place, surrounded and when they started to burn the houses around us and I saw there the young soldiers standing there and watching us and I looked at them and in this time I imagined myself being him. Being in a uniform, having a rifle in my hand, and he should be the victim. And I was thinking, \\\"Would I let him die, to be burned alive?\\\" Because there were children started to cry and I wanted to compare myself what I would do in that case like this and I couldn't understand that they came and they occupy a town and take civilian people and kill them. Because we were sure that they would keep their promise and they would burn us. So then later, the next day they started to take us to work. And every day they came and they took out everybody and there was a lot of work. The whole Polish army was broken up and we had to clean the weapons and used shells from cannons and we used to load it on trucks to take away. Also, we had maybe a hundred dead horses because it happened that this unit which came to our town this day, this was a cavalry unit and when the fighting started, the horses were killed. And the horses were laying dead, and this was still hot summer, so it start that we had to clean them up. Now Jews were not used to such kind of work, bury horses. They were not strong enough for this. So we had to dig holes and pull the horses and bury them because we were afraid of an epidemic. And so there were a case I remember that one Jew when we dug the horses, one officer came and he said to the Jew he didn't [like] him for some reason or other. And he said to go in in the hole with the horse and we had to burn him too alive. And we started to cover and with the dirt. Then in the last minute his wife found out and she came and she screamed and begged and cried. Finally, he was almost buried completely. He said, \\\"Alright, you can dig him out.\\u201d In those [days] they started to harass the Jews. They used to take old Jews with long beards and they used to harness them to wagons, and they used to sit on the wagons and they used to pull them. Just to show and make pictures and make a film. Everything to insult. In the beginning those insults were very bad, because we didn't know what awaits us. But everyday something else happened. And we got used to the yesterday's insults, but the next day there were more severe insults. So we forgot already what happened yesterday because we had to cope with the new one. And then later they gave out the curfew that Jews can only walk out from their houses between 10 in the morning til 12 noon, and then from 4 in the afternoon till 6. So you imagine only for the 2 hours to go out and to do everything what you had to do for the family. Naturally, nobody did business anymore. They confiscated the merchandise. They took away everything. And in the 2 hours you could see everybody was running, running, running because you wanted to do, to accomplish in the 2 hours what he could do in a whole day. And then later he was in a hurry to go home, not to be caught in the middle. So those were the harassments. Then later it came the harassments which couldn't walk on the sidewalk. We had to walk on the road, on the street. The first day it was terrible. What you mean I cannot walk on the sidewalk? But later we got used to it. We got used to it, so we walked on the street and if somebody walked on the sidewalk in the beginning they didn't shoot us, but they arrested them. Then later came out a order that every Jew who saw a German on the street had to take off his hat. He had to greet him. Now, so they were cases like in my father for instance, I remember, there came a young German policeman, so he took off his hat. So he went to him. He started to beat him up. And he beat him up and he said, \\\"Why do you beat me?\\\" He says, \\\"Well, because why you taking off the hat. Why you greeting me? What am I? Your friend? You are a dirty, lousy Jew and I'm a German. Why am I your friend. Why you greeting me?\\\" So the next day, when he saw a German, he didn't take off the hat. So he went and he beat him up. And he said, \\\"How long do we have to teach you when you see a German you should take off up your hat, take off your hat and bow because you are subhuman and..... So everything what they did, it was only to make life miserable. And then the war, of course, very bad because every day they caught the same people and they took them away to all kind of work, to clean the streets. And then the Poles were standing and laughing and enjoying because they didn't touch them and they were very[helpful?] and if sometimes the Germans didn't know where the Jews lived, the Poles...usually the young Polish boys used to go with the Germans. They couldn't speak German. One word they learned very fast. Jude. Jude. So they went with the Germans and they used to show the houses. Jude. Jude. Jude. That there lives a Jew. So the Germans went in and took out everybody and dragged them to work. Now the work was done and they didn't pay for it. The people were hungry. They couldn't make a few zlotys in their profession or something like this. They had to go from morning til night to work. And the worst time was in the winter. In the winter we had to clear the streets. From far away, kilometers away, for the Germans that their cars and trucks should be able to travel. So we had to stay in the snow from morning til night. Even when the snow was falling down, we still had to clean. So we sometimes asked, \\\"What's the use to clean up? In 5 minutes they will be covered with snow again?\\\" But nevertheless, we had to do it. And I was with the Germans about a month. Then something happened to my father, somebody, one of his friends denounced him to the Germans that we had hidden merchandise and the Germans took away everything we had from our warehouses. They cleared out everything. They didn't leave anything. And I said to this man...I threatened him and I said to him, \\\"Someday, I will pay you back for it.\\u201d And he went to the Germans and he told them that I'm a very dangerous. I was at this time 19 years old. I was a boy from the Yeshiva from a Rabbinical school. Before the war, I wore the long peijes. And he told them that I belonged before the war to a communist party which was against...and that I'm dangerous to the Germans, and I also said that I will go and to do some sabotage. This what he told the Germans. Now, they didn't know me, so they said that tomorrow we're gonna arrest him and we shoot him. I find out about it and I run away to Russia. To the Russia zone because Poland was divided. The western part was taken over by the Germans, and the eastern part was taken over by the Russians. So I went over to the Russian zone and I went to Lemberg [Lwow]. And I was very happy in Lemberg because there I joined a gymnasium which I always dreamed about it. And I also joined a Jewish theatrical group. There was a Jewish theatre and I always I said, \\\"If I cannot be a doctor, I want to be an actor.\\u201d I always had it in my blood. And even in home before the war when we used to make like plays for a holiday for Hanukkah for Purim, every year our school made the play. And I always had the lead in this play and I used to sing by a cantor. I had a voice soprano, so the cantor liked me and I used to sing solos. So I came to Lemberg and my dream was fulfilled. I went to a gymnasium and I joined a theater so I could play...be a part of it. So I said, \\\"Well, the war will last maybe a year or two, and I will meanwhile do what I want to do.\\u201d Meanwhile, I found out, I was there 3 months. I find out that my girlfriend which I liked...her mother is gravely ill and she was only with her mother because her father and brother and sister were on the Russian side. So I find out about it. I decided to come home. And I came back to the Germans. And I will never forget, this was already in January. We had to put white sheets over us to camouflage the snow and we went through the border and we were caught. Those are long stories. I don't want to dwell on how we were caught by the Russians, and then they had to take us to jail to Lemberg, back to Russia. We knew once we are in the jail, so after from the jail, they send us to Siberia. So during the night, we overpowered the guards and we tied them down with blankets. We took away their rifles, and we went back to the border and this time we managed to cross the border.  Well, there was one man. Before the war, he was a horse dealer. And he lived in the section where the border is. The town's name was Jarloslaw. It was known that every week he takes a group of people who want to go to back. And when we came back he took a group of people who want to run away from the German side. So he was like a smuggler. He was a Jewish man. And he took at this time 15 boys from our town who wanted to go back. Because in the beginning they couldn't make a living in Lemberg. It was very bad. There were thousands and thousands of refugees. They didn't have where to live, where to sleep. So here somebody told us that the Jews live in their houses. It's bad under the Germans. They have to work. They have to do certain things. But the atrocities didn't start right in the beginning, so they figured they will come home. I came home because on account of this girl. Maybe subconsciously I wanted to be with the family too. And I will never forget the day that I came home, my father was sitting in our kitchen studying some Talmud, and I came in and he saw me and I said, \\\"I'm back.\\u201d And he didn't lift his eyes. While looking still in the book, he said, \\\"As much as I am happy to see you, you made the biggest mistake in your life that you came back.\\u201d Those were his words when he saw me when I came back. And naturally when I came back the first week, I was hiding because I was afraid that somebody would say, \\\"The police.\\u201d because I remembered that they wanted me. But this was already new police, and nobody remembered and I joined the Jews with their misery in our town going to work and starting to do business and my father still had this little store, but it was little in this time. But he didn't come in in the store, because he was a Jew with a long beard and it was like a red cloth when you want to aggravate a bull. So my sisters were in the store and I started to travel to different towns, and brought in merchandise, mostly black market. And this how we started to make a living. And I was the young in the family, so I had to do it, and I did it to support all my sisters because I had the three married sisters. Their husbands were not capable to do it. They were very religious Jews with the beards and I was young. They didn't speak so good Polish. So I used to travel every day someplace else and to bring in merchandise and to sell it and to make money. And we worked like this til about spring of 1940. Spring of 1940, they made a registration, so all the Jews had to be registered. And then they used to make like...there came a few high officers from Rzeszow, and they took us in a big building and they made like a selection. From the people who were registered, they picked out at this time 200 young boys and we had to come to the places where trucks were waiting. And they send us to a labor camp. This was the first time they made this registration. And the labor camp was in a town...in a village called Leipvia. This was near a town Novisanz. This was near the southern border this was in the Carpathian mountains. Our work was that we had to break rocks. It was like a quarry where we had to break rocks, but the problem was that what we did...when we broke up the rocks we had to transport them to a place on hand wagons, on wheel barrels, and the next day we took the same rocks and we brought them back to the first place. And this was our work. It was very hard work. And they gave us very little food. But it wasn't so bad because in this time, this was in 1940, our people in our town still lived in their homes. They still had what to eat. And the post office could send...we could send packages. So the community from our town used to send every week a package to every prisoner. And they send it to the community of Novasanz, of this town. And this Jewish community brought it us to the camp. So we had enough. After 2 or 3 months, we started to run away. And all of us run away. And the Germans didn't even look for us even run away. What did they do? When everybody run away, they had from different towns, also young people, so they went to other town and brought in other transport. So they didn't bother looking for us. So I came back from this camp and I started to work by the Germans. So they took me and we started to build garages for the Wehrmacht. And they accepted me. They also made us register, they looked us over who is young and strong, so because of my work. So everyday I went to work. They didn't pay us for the work, but I was glad to go to work for them so they wouldn't catch me to work different work like cleaning the streets, cleaning the buildings. Because I had to go work anyways. At least I went in the morning. I had a pass that nobody should grab me from the street. And we worked there. And once being with those Germans or working in the garages, so I used to buy for them a quart of kerosene, a loaf of bread. I used to bring to the Germans a few eggs, and we exchanged this. And it was there where I worked. And sisters were in the store, and they did some business buying this from peasants and selling some produce. It was not like before the war, but we thought it is bad, but somehow we will survive. They didn't lull at this time. But Jews for every little things were arrested. They were harassed. And they caught the slaughter the Shochet who used to slaughter for a kosher meat, so they arrested him. After 2 weeks, they paid a lot of ransom...they paid money, they let him out. And everything was done with money, you could buy yourself out by the German police. And we still lived in our houses, so it wasn't so bad. But we knew that we are under German occupation, and also we heard stories from other towns about atrocities. There was a town Mielec, for instance, not far from my town, so when the Germans came in, they took about 200 Jews and they put them in in the shul, in the temple, and also in the public bath and they closed the doors and they burned the people with the buildings.  No. No. No. This I didn't see, but this was in the next town. So we heard about atrocities from different towns, but they asked...it was just arresting contribution...we had to pay money, but nothing terrible happened. Until in the fall of 1940, they came, they established a very notorious camp near us named Pruszkow, and Pruszkow was an SS camp. Now Pruszkow was established because this was the place where they started experiments for the V-1, V-2, rockets. This is the first what they did it, and they picked out this place because there were a lot of woods. In Poland, there was a section, it was called Pushun Sandomerska . It means the wilderness of Sandomierz, the town. Before the 18th century practically, nobody could go through it. It was old, virgin forest. Later, people started to make villages, towns. In this section of Pruszkow Sandomerzko, they made the first experiments. They brought in Jews and Poles too, and they worked there for a certain time. Later, they killed the people. They were afraid that they would run away and they would start to tell stories about those experiments. I remember that during the day, three or four times you could hear a boom, a noise, but you didn't see a airplane. You didn't see anything. You could hear it. It sound like something is flying then noise, then it was an explosion in the air. You could see a ball of fire and it disappeared. And this happened a few times a days, so this were the experiments that they used to shoot the rockets, but they exploded. Then later when the rockets exploded, then on the places pieces of cast aluminum used to fall on the ground. Now the peasants used to collect it and they used to make utensils, spoons, jars, cups, everything they used to make from this. So the Germans didn't want it should be, and they used to send out special police to go and collect those items. And this came from Pruszkow. So in 1941, at the end of 40, I was taken to Pruszkow. Again, there came a commission, and they took the young people and they looked through and while they picked out the people, they beat up everybody. And I remember I was beaten up terrible. I was standing in line, then somebody and I didn't move so fast, so SS men with their rifle butt hit me in the back and I flew to the front and I feel down and I was all bleeding. So the man who was in charge, his name was Schmidt. He was a Feldwebel, I mean a Scharfuhrer from the SS. And he saw me on the floor, so they picked me up, and I was bleeding from my mouth, from my nose. So he came out and he said, \\\"Hey, what happened to you?\\\" Like not...he joked around. So he took out a handkerchief and he gave the handkerchief I should wipe the blood. So I wiped the blood. He said, \\\"Now, clean my boots.\\u201d So with my blood, I had to take and I had to wipe his boots with the blood.\\u201d So those were the things that they were terrible in this time, but looking back those were things that you could survive. They were terrible, but it was not extermination. It was not killing off everybody. But in this time, those were the bad things. So I was taken to Pruszkow. They were so vicious that when they took us on open trucks and they took in this maybe 100 from our town in the open trucks, when we traveled, they took us by the trucks to Pruszkow. The driver purposefully, in Poland on the road, on both sides, there were trees. Now trees were not high so he purposely drove the truck under the trees where the branches were sticking out and the people should be hurt, and a few of them were hurt. It cut open their heads and all that because the truck went in the branches. I was in Pruszkow about 6 weeks. During the time, every night was there a ritual. When there was the appell, this Schmidt picked out somebody and he was hanged. We all had to watch by the appell how the man was hanged. And usually he picked out somebody of us, and he was the hangman. Now there were times in the books that I am writing there and I give more details, so there was a times that he picked somebody who didn't want to hang the other Jew. So he took a knife and he cut his throat because he didn't want to hang him. And also this Schmidt had a habit, when we walked to work we cut trees because they wanted to make the camp a little larger, so he used to shoot just in our rank, in our column. Not aiming. So once I was hit in my right arm. And it was very difficult to work because the hand, but he didn't do no damage and I with somebody's help, I was transferred to other detail to put up telephone poles through the town of Tarnow. And one time when I lifted a telephone pole, I dislocated a disc in my neck and I couldn't straighten out. And then I knew that if 1 would be there and they would find out that this happen, they would shoot me because what do they need a man with a dislocated disc? And then with the help of somebody I escaped, and I came back home.  01  Well, when I was shot, so the Germans, they didn't know would be tied down to 1, 10 men. I went to work. It was hard too, because we worked there cutting the trees. So it was hard, but with the help with others, they covered me. You know, in a camp the comradeship, the friendship was so big that everybody would do everything for his friend. Even we were strangers we became so friendly that at times even they would endanger their lives to help their other friend. So they covered, but when I dislocated a disc it was very bad for me. I used to hold on to two guys when we worked I should be a little straight. And I knew that I would not be able to hide this a long time. So there was a man who was in charge of the Jewish columns. It so happens that this man was a cousin of my girlfriend. And I told him this. His name was Kleinhandler from Tarnow. And he was the head, he was like a middle man between the workers of Tarnow in this Pruszkow camp. So through him, he recommended me to somebody else and through the other man helped me to escape. He opened a truck when I went to work...a truck went to a town Bembitza.. And he told me to go on the truck, and they took me away. Because the truck was a SS truck, but he had to pick out so many workers to go to this town so he picked me out. He knew that I have his name, I remember even was Immergluck . And he was not very much liked, because he did things that he didn't have to do to the Jewish workers. But to me, he was good because this other friend told him to do it, so he picked me up and they helped me go on the truck and they took me to work supposedly to the Bembitza to bring some merchandise or to bring some supplies. So I went to Bembitza, the Jews were still there, so I didn't go back. And that's it. They didn't look for me. I came home and I started to wear a brace. And then later after a few weeks, it healed. I had problems later, but I could walk out. I came back home. The situation started to be much worse, every day, every day, you could see that the situation is worse. Then later we received, we got in our town a Land Kommissar which is the head of the county, because our town was the county seat, and there came a Land commissar, and his name was Farting. And he was the biggest sadist ever lived. And he was a German, but he also was a Polish guy, because he spoke German and Polish. And this was very bad, because he could speak to the Polish people and he could find out a lot of things which was not healthy for us. So this Farding came to us as a LandKommissar. Before he used to be in the Gestapo in Rzeszow. So they said and we used to say he is so bad because he has all bad things from both nations, the bad things from the Germans and the bad things from the Poles, and he combined it in one person. He looked like a caricature. He was short, very fat, with a big belly, a shaved head which in the sun it was gleaming like a mirror, small little eyes like a pig, very small piercing eyes, and he had a voice that it was like a shrilled voice, like it came from animal or something, very shrill you say, and he was very shrewd, very smart. And he wanted to outsmart everybody, but he was very vicious. So when he came he organized a ghetto in our town. And our ghetto was organized before large towns had ghetto because we already had a ghetto in June 1941, which was very early. And he pushed into the ghetto, where before used to be 70 Poles, he put in 2,000. And it was very cramped. And we lived in the ghetto. And then we had an old man who was the President of the Judenrat, which was a Doctor Unterman. And I think this Doctor Unterman should be remembered. If the Jews would have in their religion to make a saint of somebody, I think he should have been the first saint. Because being that president of the Judenrat, he actually sacrificed his life for the Jews. Before the war, this Doctor Unterman didn't consider himself a Jew. He was a assimilated Jew. He never bothered with Jews. He never belonged to a temple. He never even stepped in a Jewish temple. Only had his friends with the Polish people because he was a Polish officer, and was a Polish patriot, and he was considered by them that he was one of the most important people in our town. But with Jews he never had anything to do. He had Jewish, had Jewish patients, but that's all. When the war started he saw that he can speak to the Germans different than a Jew with a long beard. He was clean shaven. He was a captain in the Austrian army. He  studied medicine in Vienna, spoke beautiful German, and he could stand up to them. Now, again, he couldn't understand that the Germans will be so vicious and he thought with him they will think twice. So he agreed to become the president, which before he said, \\\"What I have nothing to do with Jews?\\\" But later, we convinced him and he said he will become president if he would pick out 12 people which he liked with him. And he picked out 12 younger people, Jews without beards, people who were outstanding citizens before the war. Honest people. Fine people. And he said, \\\"If they will be with me in the Judenrat, then I will be come the Hauptman. And they agreed. As a matter of fact, between the 12 people, he picked out my older brother and my brother-in-law he was one of the 12. And he ran this Judenrot that I don't think so that any Judenrot was run like this. He was so honest. I don't know if we should go in details, but Linda, I'll give you two examples. Once they brought in, they gave to the Jews to divide pieces of soap, to give every family a piece of soap. And the Judenrat divided the soap. And then about 5 kilo soap was left. It was more than they...so the Judenrat, the man who was in charge of dividing the soap, he made 13 packages to give what's left over to each member of the Judenrat to take home. And one was for Dr. Unterman. And Dr. Unterman came in, and they said, \\\"This is for you.\\u201d He said, \\\"What is it?\\\" He said, \\\"Well, this is the soap.\\u201d He says, \\\"But I already got soap, what I suppose to get.\\u201d \\\"Well, this was left.\\u201d And they explained it. And he said, \\\"It was left and how much?\\\" And they said, \\\"We made 13 packages.\\u201d He said, \\\"I want to see the 13 packages.\\u201d So they brought back what everybody took for himself. He opened it and he said, \\\"Give me a list of 13 poorest Jews in our town.\\u201d So they picked out 13 poor Jews. \\\"I want everybody should get a package. Not you. Not I.\\u201d And he divided...this kind of man way he was. Like to the Germans he spoke to them like to equals. Like this Farding who came in, he wanted to take over Unterman's house because he built this house a year before the war. And because he was a physician he was well off. And he built a beautiful house, and this was the only house in our town that had electricity. He had his own generator. The only one in town that he had indoor plumbing. He made it a beautiful house. So naturally, Farding wanted this house. So he asked him, \\\"I want to move in. Why don't you move in into the ghetto.\\u201d So he told him, \\\"In the ghetto I will move in til the last Jew will have a roof over his head. So long as the last Jew doesn't have a roof over his head, I will not move in.\\u201d Then later this Farding said, \\\"The Judenrat will have to pay 10,000 zlotys to me to renovate the house.\\u201d He said, \\\"Renovate? I Just built it. And besides if 1 could live in it, you can live in it. And then why should you renovate. After the war will end, I will come back to my house. You will go back to Germany.\\u201d Now he didn't like this thing, we were in the ghetto about 2 weeks, he took the whole Judenrat with Dr. Unterman and he arrested them and they were sitting in jail in Kolbuszowa about a week or 2 weeks. They they were sent to Rzeszow and from Rzeszowize they were sent to Auschwitz. In Auschwitz, there were orders was right in the beginning. This was in the fall of 1941. In this time, you hardly knew that Auschwitz exists. And then they were sent to Auschwitz, and after 2, 3 weeks, telegrams started to come to the families, and the telegram said that your husband died on cancer. Other one your husband died on heart attack. Your husband died while he was running away. And then it was a letter that the widow had to sign that her husband suffered for cancer for 2 years, that her husband had heart trouble for 4 years. Why they did it, why this evidence they needed, I don't know. But they had to sign a letter that he actually was sickly and to add salt to the wound, everybody received a bill for the cremation. They said people were cremated and the cremation cost so and so much, and you will have to pay the money. So every widow had to pay money for the cremation. Now when the Judenrot was liquidated, naturally, Fardring organized a new Judenrot. But [for] this Judenrat he already picked out people who he liked. And this Judenrat, I wouldn't say that they were murderers, but they were more to the liking of the Germans than Dr. Unterman. That the old man of this Judenrat wouldn't go out and wouldn't, if there was left there 13 packages of soap, he wouldn't say divide it to the poor. He probably would say I want the whole 13 packages. This was a different. And then it was life started to be more and more terrible. Another [thing] I want to tell you about is Dr. Unterman. When he saw that the Jews are so poor and they cannot afford a doctor, so he organized an ambulatorium. And every day he gave 2 hours, he was sitting in the ambulatorium, and this was in my sister's apartment, and everybody who was sick who couldn't pay could come to him, and he treated the people. And then later the Judenrat had to pay for medicine what they received. Because he liked me, so he took me in the ambulatorium I should be his assistant. As I mentioned before, I always wanted to be a doctor. So I worked with him and he taught me how to open wounds, how to clean wounds, how to put in all kinds of ointments, how to bandage, all those things. And I worked with him every day and he showed me all these things. This gave me opportunity when we were later in our camp, which we come to it, and we were in the woods I became the doctor, the so-called doctor. We had to do some medically, I always had that little suitcase with all kind of instruments which I inherited after he was killed. And I had this and I used to treat the people as much as I could, as much as he taught me. So this Doctor Unterman got killed, and the Judenrat got killed. He had a wife with a son, and his wife, after he was arrested, the wife with the son escaped to Warsaw and they lived as Aryans, illegal people, Poles, illegal papers which they could very easily survive because they didn't look Jewish, and their language was only Polish. And during the uprising, not the ghetto uprising, but the general uprising in Warsaw, her son was a officer of the AK, the Polish underground, and he was killed. She survived and came to America, and after the war and since then she died. So men like this should be remembered because we didn't have too many people like this. Actually, the Poles begged him to escape from jail in Kolbuszowa, and they wanted to take him and hide him and do anything for him. And he said, \\\"I cannot do it, because I cannot leave the Jews, because nobody will stick up for them.\\u201d And he thought that he would be able to speak up, and then later they got rid of him. Now once he was killed yes, also under his administration, because you asked me I should tell about me. Because I before the war, I  01  So when the second Judenrat came into power...meanwhile, we had all kind of new orders. Orders like to give up all the furs, and if somebody would have a fur, and they would be caught with a piece of fur in the ghetto and would be shot. So naturally most of the Jews gave the Germans the furs. I remember there came a truck.  Fur. Fur. Fur. And then they had collars and fur, they gave them. And it was not a rich town, so you could see somebody had there a coat with a fur lining, it was maybe a 100 years [old] or so. It was all falling apart. But they brought it over. Everybody was afraid. Some younger woman had Persian Lamb coats because this was the style. So some didn't give the Persian Lamb coats because it was valuable, so we used to hide it or give it to peasants to hide. I remember one of my sisters had a Persian Lamb coat, so she gave it to me and I brought it out from the ghetto to somebody who we trusted and they should hide it for us, which by the way they never gave it back to us. And then there were other contributions. Once this Farding came in and he said he wants to have 10 kilo of gold. Ten kilo of gold in our town...they were poor Jews...how could they could, but I knew how. But this new president from the Judenrot, his name was Pashek Rappaport. He was very energetic. And people were sometimes afraid of him. So he somehow managed to get together the 10 kilo gold to give it to Farding. And when they gave it to Farding, so he said, \\\"You know, you saved 20 Jewish lives with it because I was prepared to kill 20 people if you wouldn't give that 20 kilo gold.\\u201d I remember to the gold, everybody gave what he had, a wedding band, a pair of earrings, but 10 kilo is a lot. So I remember there was still missing, this night I will never forget that my father came and he brought a package and he opened it and he had there, he said I'm going to give this too to save lives, so he opened it and there was a gold watch on a long chain like in this time the women used to wear a gold chain with a watch and also he had in this package a cigarette box from gold. So he said, \\\"I'm going to give it. You see when I was engaged with your mother,\\\" he told me, \\\"I gave her this watch, and she gave me this cigarette and I saved it through the first world war. I had it hidden, and now I'm going to give it.\\u201d And he gave it. And now the Jews gave...and we came up with the 10 kilo gold and then he said we saved so many lives. And every day new atrocities a new one on top of one [that] was not finished, the other came up. The other came up. We lived in this time in the ghetto. We were fortunate that my brother's apartment was in the ghetto, so we could move into his, so he had two rooms, so we moved in in one room and he had one room. I had three married sisters, so one of my sisters lived in the place where the ghetto was with the other two sisters moved in. So somehow I was appointed by the new Judenrot to my old job to go to other towns and to bring in the merchandise which was very helpful. But in December of 1941, I went once to Rzeszow, and Rzeszowi was a epidemic of dysentery. And a lot of people died. And I ate there. I remember I bought two tomatoes, and I ate the two tomatoes and I came home and I had dysentery. And this was very dangerous because with the Germans, because this was very contagious and when the Germans find out that there is somebody with dysentery, probably they would have me killed. So we didn't tell nobody. I went to the attic, and my younger sister which was the dearest to me because we were the closest in age. She was 3 years older. Her name was Rachel. And we decided I would be on the attic. We wouldn't tell nobody, and she was with me during all the time. She used to give me food, what I could eat, and she used to take away from me what was necessary because it had to buried because the Germans. And I somehow survived this dysentery. We didn't have no injections. We didn't have no doctor. And as I recuperated I got middle ear infection, and  I started to have terrible pain. And, again, no doctor so home remedies. We used to put in oil and this and that and it went on and on and got worse and worse and worse. And after 3 weeks, the pains were so terrible, I cannot describe the pains because everything was infected. So this was in the winter. Somehow my brother got a sleigh with somebody, and they took me out from the ghetto, and they brought me to the ghetto in Rzeszow, to Dr. Heller. He was a . It was a specialist for ear, throat and nose. And he said that I have to have an operation right away. If I wouldn't have operation, I would die because all the puss was around the brain, but he cannot operate. There is no facilities. There are no Jewish hospital in Rzeszow, and I cannot go to a non-Jewish hospital. So I went there with my sisters. I was there with my sisters. So I have to go to Krakow. How can you go to Krakow? Jews are not permitted to ride by train. So my brother went back to Kolbuszowa and somehow he managed to get a false...from this Rappaport some that he had, a pass signed by this Farding, by this Land Kommissar, but it was not made out to nobody, so he made out my name with my sisters and they took me, with the train, to Krakow. On the train, a young Polish boy came up and he saw that there are three Jews, my two sisters and myself. He said, \\\"What are Jews doing on the train?\\\" He said, \\\"I'm coming now from Germany. I work in Germany. In Germany, they wouldn't allow Jews on the train.\\u201d And he started to speak to the rest of the people. He said, \\\"We cannot have Jews on the train. We have to throw them out.\\u201d And they came to us and they wanted to throw us out from the running train. So my sister started to cry and to beg. They said, \\\"Look this man...this boy is almost dead. He's so sick. He needs an operations.\\u201d My head was all with bandages. So some people they said, \\\"Well, Let's...let's wait til a station.\\u201d There was a station. So this man went down. He brought up two policemen, German policemen, and he said, \\\"I want you should throw them down because they are Jews.\\u201d So we showed him the papers. So the policeman said, \\\"What...we cannot do anything. They have the Passier Schein.\\u201d That means they have a pass for travel. So again they started to yell, \\\"Oh, we don't want to travel with Jews. So we will throw them out.\\u201d Again the same story, and my sisters begged them so they said okay. We'll not throw you out, but the next stop you have to go out. So we had to choice. The next stop. Meanwhile, they caught the other Jew, and they threw him out from the running station. Not the Germans, the Poles. So the next station we stopped. So happens that it was in Tarnow. And Tarnow was quite a big town. I knew Tarnow because I went to the Yeshiva in Tarnow, and we had there a cousin. We came to the cousin and we were very lucky that in Tarnow there was a doctor. His name was David Rabinowitz. And this David Rabinowitz, he was the chief surgeon in Lodz in a hospital in the name of Poznanski, a very rich manufacturer. And he was thrown out from Lodz and he came to Tarnow. So we came to him, and he looked at me and he said, \\\"I don't think so we can do anything to this boy because it's too long. Everything is already full with puss.\\u201d But anyway, they made an operation. The operation took 8 hours, and he operated and he said, \\\"Well, he will be deaf or blind or something or he will die.\\u201d But anyway, he operated so that after 3, 4 weeks my hearing came back and when he operated he even cut the drum for the puss to come out, and then later he sew it. He was a wonderful man and I became alright and I came home with my head all bandaged and in our town they already spoke about it that I'm dead already. Now I want to tell you what happened to this David Rabinowitz. He was such a wonderful surgeon, such a wonderful man;a Jewish doctor couldn't operate on a Gentile. But there was a case that somebody was very sick on the same thing and there was not a Polish doctor he should do this operation because it was a very delicate operation. They came to him, and he told them, \\\"I cannot operate on a non-Jew.\\u201d So they said, \\\"Listen, you have to save this man.\\u201d He went and he operated.\\u201d And he saved him. About a week later, a brother-in-law of the man who was operated...a Polish guy also, went to the Germans and he told them that this Rabinowitz operated on his brother-in-law. They came to the hospital, and from the hospital they they dragged him out to the yard, and they shot him. They shot him because he operated a non-Jew. And he saved him. Well, those were the times. So when I came home, the whole situation in Kolbuszowa was already different. During the 3 months, everything was pushed toward the end and we didn't know in this time that are  death camps, gas chambers. This was in April 1942, and this time you didn't have any transports yet, but we could feel from the Germans' behavior that every day something else came up. When I came back so I got back my job. Instead to go to work, I got back my job to go for merchandise from the other towns, and I got the pass. I took over the ambulatorium from Dr. Unterman and I got all his instruments and I got medicine. I already knew what medicines applied to this and which medicine applied to his, and I bought in the Apotheke more medicine so I got a pass that I am in Gesundheitsdienst, which means a health service, that I could go out from the ghetto if it's needed, which was very helpful. And we lived again in the ghetto. And this was the 28th of April, the 28th of April, 1942, we were sitting home and we had dinner cause dinner was not at night, but dinner was around 12, | o'clock. And what the dinner was, probably a tomato soup, a potato soup, something very austere. So we were sitting, and then we hear somebody knocking on the door downstairs, and from the knocking we right away knew it's Germans because this was their knocking. Not knocking, banging. And somebody looked through the window. They saw two Gestapo men standing, because their uniforms, the Gestapo had uniforms with SS, and we knew their banging. So the first thing my sisters bolted the door from the inside, and the first thing was to hide the men, because in this time we thought the men are most vulnerable. So my brother and I we were home, so we ran out through the back door through the yard. We run out to a neighbor, and we run to the attic. We thought maybe they come to us, they will not go to them. My sister took my father and they put him in the outhouse in the yard and put in a padlock on the door to make believe that nobody is there because the padlock is on the outside. And he was there. They were banging and banging. When they saw that not nobody opens and they cannot break down the door, one of the Gestapo went around the houses to see to go from the back entrance. And then my sister was afraid that maybe it's not a good place for my father to be there because they keep banging. Maybe he should go where I am hiding, so she went and she opened the  02  Okay. So this how we were chased out from our town. There was one episode that I have to tell you. There was a man. He actually was from Germany. He was a Jew from Germany. He came back to our town, and he walked with his wife, with his son, and with his mother-in- law, and father-in-law, after the wagon. But in one moment he made a mistake. Instead to be on the right side, he was on the left side. A German policeman which was from our town. I remember even his name, Barthelmus, took a rifle and shot him. He fell down. His wife and his child, he had a 12 year old child, couldn't even stop for a moment to go and to see what happened with him. He was left laying on the street. They had to go forward. Now I went to the third day, not the first day. The reason I went the third day because we still had things and merchandise and I wanted to be there two days to give it out during the night to friendly Poles. Maybe we'll come back. Maybe we'll retrieve it. So after the Jews went out with their wagons, we went and we took this men on the hand wagon and we brought him to the cemetery and we buried him. And I remembered he wore a grey suit, a grey suit with blue stripes, and he had yellow shoes. Usually by us, Jews didn't wear this kind of clothing, but he was from Germany. He had modern clothes. So I remember the grey suit with blue, not stripes, blue squares. And we buried him. About a week later or 2 weeks later when we came back, I had to go to the cemetery because they killed somebody and I went to bury them. You see, before my father was killed, I never saw a dead person. The minute my father was lulled, I don't know, every time they had to bury somebody, it pulled me. I wanted to do it. I wanted to do it. And before I never saw it. So somebody was killed, so I took him to the cemetery. When I took him to the cemetery, the caretaker of the cemetery, he was an old Polish man, I saw him wearing a grey suit with blue squares with yellow shoes. So we buried him. I knew that he wouldn't let it go. He uncovered him and he took it out and he wore it. Now we were in Rzeszow. They brought into Rzeszow Jews. In Rzeszow were in this time about 30,000 Jews. They brought into Rzeszow from this town maybe other 40,000 Jews from all the little towns. There was not enough place...I'm not talking about apartments or to have a roof over your head. There was not enough place in the alley ways, on the streets, for all the Jews to put some place. And they came with those wagons. They brought their things, some better, some worse. Every peasant who came to do the service was told that if he brings the Jews to Rzeszow, if he has two horses the Jew must pay him 200 zlotys for transportation. If he has one horse, the Jew must pay him 100 zlotys for the transportation. In case the Jew doesn't have the money or doesn't give him the money, because sometimes they didn't have, he shouldn't let unload the sacks. This was his pay. He can go home what they put on the wagon and take it for himself because they didn't pay him. So a lot of people didn't have the 200 slotas so they took away right away which didn't make a difference. The Germans took it away later. So I came to Rzeszow the third day, and Rzeszow was...sometimes if you talk about tower of Babel how the people couldn't understand [one another]. This was the tower of Babel. People were running around like crazy. Children lost their parents. Parents lost their  02  Okay. Alright. Okay. So when we came to Rzeszow...when I came the third day, and when I saw those things what's going on there with the people. So Farding gave out an order that he needs...you see, our town...there were four towns belonged to our town...our county...that he needs hundred young boys for each town to go back, and he will make a camp, a labor camp. The reason...we should destroy, taking apart the ghetto. To Sokolov, Glogov, ?? , and ?? . I volunteered with my brother to go back. The reason I volunteered because I thought I will be back. I have peasants that I know. I will be able to buy food somehow to send it to our family to the ghetto, Rzeszow, because in Rzeszow they would starve. But without sending them somehow, we would. So we went back. We walked a whole night back. In the morning we were taken into the Shul, to the temple, to the Houses of Study, and this became our barracks, and this became our new life to be in a labor camp in Kolbuszowa. Meanwhile the people were taken to Belzec, and they were made four transports from the people. In the four transports within every week two transports, and they cleared up the big ghetto, the large ghetto and everybody was left who had a card to work, they put in the small ghetto. And the small ghetto, and they liquidated the big ghetto, and we were in this time in the camp. And we started to work as a labor camp. What we did in the beginning we started to destroy the houses, taking apart. We saved everything for the Germans. For the Germans was very important to have old material, scrap, because they could make new material. So we picked out one house, and one room was paper, and one was brass and lead and so on and so on. And we destroyed this ghetto. Destroying the ghetto was a very painful thing because we knew the people. And we destroyed 300 years of a continuation of people who lived in this town for 300 years, they were conceived in those houses. They died in those houses. They were married in those houses. And now the people are gone, and the houses are being destroyed. We threw down from the attics things that you would never believe that people saved those things. And you could see the poverty of the people. They never throw out anything. Old iron beds, old iron stoves, barrels. Everything we threw it out. And then later the house came down. We knocked it down. You could see the dust, and the dust went up and then you could see 300 years of life in this little Stetl, that it was destroyed. We cleared the ghetto. We made a field out of it. And we still didn't know what happened to our people. So we sent...we took a Pole. We paid him money, and we send him to go with the road where the trains went and then he came back and he told us the story. That they were taken to Belzec, and then we find out that they are death camps. This was the first time that they sent to death camps, which Belzec was. They tried out how to do it, so Belzec...it was not a crema...it was not gas chambers like in Auschwitz, sophisticated with Zyklon. In Belzec, they had old motors, and then with the gas, with the carbon monoxide and then later they buried the people. They burned them. This how we find out that our people are dead. We worked in this camp, and we knew that the end will be soon because we almost destroyed the ghetto and there was not any more work. Why would they keep us. So they get us...we had a river in our town. So he get us to regulate the river, to make it straight the banks. So we worked there. But soon we knew that we will what will they need? Farding played around with us. We were like his small army. We had between our people a man. His name was Lampel. He was a sergeant in the Austrian army. He was a drill sergeant. So he told them to drill us, and we used to march like soldiers.  02  We worked in this camp. And we had [it] quite good. The reason why? We didn't have no German guards. All the towns around us were Judenrein. There were no Jews around anymore because all the Jews were taken away. We had in our section, we had a few labor camps, which the German organized. One was in Breshatka, and one was in Hutta Komarovska, and one was in Mielec. Mielec was quite known, because this was the second place that they tattooed people. They didn't give numbers, but they had on their head a KL. KL it means Konzentrations Lager. Now if some people had the KL, I know they were in Mielec. And this was very close to us. And we didn't have no guards. It means that we were on our own. But Farding got us together, and he said, \\\"If one of us will escape, 10 of us...10 will be hanged.\\u201d He made us responsible for everybody, to make sure nobody will escape. And every day we went to work. Then later, suddenly, I became friendly with Farding, and it was very...there was one town, Sokolow. Sokolow belonged to us....to our county. The night of the expulsion of the Jews in Sokolow, when they told them to go to Rzeszow ghetto, Farding came to Sokolow drunk. And he said he wants Jews. So they started to bring him old Jews, because they figured the old Jews will not survive the trips or something. He wanted and so they brought them...and he started to kill them. And he killed in this night...he killed 49 Jews by himself with his own hand. He was drunk. He had a bottle of vodka. He drank Vodka, and he killed. They brought him Jews and he killed. There was a pile of Jews. But he was such a sadist, and he knew everything about Jewish religion because they...like I told you before he spoke Polish. He said, \\\"He's going to kill the Jews to make them kosher. They should go straight to heaven because they will be kosher.\\u201d And he told them he's going to do with the Jews the same thing as Jews did with chickens before the war. Ifa chicken had to be made kosher, and if it had to be soaked in water, then later put in salt on all sides, and then later this had to be done in the night with candles, two candles...had to be held near the chicken to see if everything is correct. So he got the two Jews holding candles. He had there a bag of salt. And every time he shot a Jew, he took salt and he put it on the wound and he said, \\\"You see, now I make it kosher, and now the Jew go straight to Heaven.\\u201d Those were the things to add to all that terrible things they did. They played with us, like a cat plays with a mouse before...before it [kills]... So this Farding suddenly became friendly with me. Now the reason why he became friendly with me...I knew why. Because he liked to have somebody who should confident...who should get confident and later to find out all kind of stories that he wants to know. Like he had there a young boy and I write about him a lot...a boy from 16 years, and he promoted him in the Rzeszow ghetto to be the assistant commandant of the Police. A 16 year old boy...his name was Isaac Silber. He was from our town. And if you speak to a Rzeszow Jew about Issac Silber, you will know a lot. Issac Silber was from my town. He was born by my town. And before the war, his mother...he didn't have a father...his mother used to be the one...she wished to work in the public baths. Very low people. And this Isaac Silber was very smart, and he started to be a friend with Farding. Farding kept him, and he found out from him everything he wanted, and for this reason when the Jews were sent to Belzec, he promoted him. And he make him the assistant commandant in Rzeszow. A young boy from 16 years old. So he became the famous Isaac Silber. We used to call him Itschele. Itschele was his name. So he became friendly ... Probably he thought that becoming friendly with me, maybe he would get a second Itschele or something. Now the reason how I got together with him is when we came back, he found a warehouse with hundreds of crates with all kind of merchandise. And on the crates was written Isaac Salsitz. I don't know if you remember, when my father...in the beginning of the war, somebody squealed, and the Germans came and took away all the merchandise. It took them three days to take out everything we had. This was never used. They put in a warehouse, and it was laying there. Now Farding finds out...they found it, so he needed somebody who knew about this merchandise. So he came to our commandant of our camp, which was a Jewish man from Krakow. His name was Henry Mundt, and he said, Mundt I need somebody to clear out this warehouse. So he said what you need better. I have here a son from Isaac Salsitz. Who knows better? So he went...took me. He sent me home with him, and I come in and I see our merchandise was laying there. And what he wanted...I should make packages...to unpack everything, and make packages from soap, from coffee, from chocolate, from tea, from cocao. All those things what they don't have in Germany, I made packages and I send it away. I made ready to send it to his home. So I worked there. And while I was working there every day in the morning they took me in this room. I worked there, and then in the afternoon, they let me out for lunch. They let me out. They searched me if I don't steal anything. Steal my own stuff. And they let me back for lunch. And this I went every day. The other boys worked to demolishing the houses or regulating the river, and I worked there. He used to come in every time, and he used to discuss with me things. And his biggest pleasure was to speak to me about girls. And somehow he told me stories that since he was a young boy he was with girls. And he wanted to hear stories from me, and Thad invent stories to tell him what womanizer I was. I didn't know her, but I had to tell him because he loved it. He even taught me all kind of expressions. He said do you remember Martin Luther famous saying, not the Martin Luther King, but Martin Luther, so his famous saying was (in German) . It means twice a week it wouldn't hurt him, it wouldn't her, and it makes in a year 102, what is right. This was his famous saying. And then every time he talked different things and he asked me... One time he came in and he said to me, \\\"Do you know what happened to your family?\\\" We knew already in this time that our family is dead. So I said, \\\"No, I would like to know.\\u201d He said, \\\"Yes, I saw your family last week in the Ukraine.\\u201d They were already dead 3, 4 months. He said, \\\"If you want, I can take you...if I have my few days off, I go to Lwow with my car. I will take you along and I will take you to your family where they work in a Kolkhoz. They work on a farm.\\u201d So I knew the family is dead. I said, \\\"This would be nice.\\u201d He said, \\\"I will do it.\\u201d This...I don't know....he played around like this. One day we came out, 12 o'clock from this warehouse. I had a other man working with me. And we stopped in a place where they used to distribute milk for free. There was a milk factory, but they got the skim milk. They brought it over there, and the Poles used to stand in line and get milk for their family. So we made out that they gave for our kitchen...we had a kitchen there in our camp...that they gave for our kitchen every day 50 quarts of milk. We made sour milk, other things. But we didn't have time to stand in line because there was always a long line. So I made up with a person who was in charge. So in the morning we went to work. On the way I left the container. And when we came, lunch time, I took the container, brought it to the kitchen and went back to work. One day I come for the milk . There was a big line. There was one woman from our town. She was pretty girl...but she was not the nicest person. She was a very loose woman, and during the war she had a lot of German lovers. Anyway. So she said to me, \\\"You cannot go and take the milk without standing in line. You're not better than we. You have to stand in line.\\u201d So I explained to her...I knew her from before the war...so I explained to her I cannot stay in line because only I have is a half hour to go and eat and go back. She said, \\\"I don't care. If you don't stand in line, I will take the milk and I will pour it out.\\u201d I didn't think she would do it, so I took the milk without, and she run to me, took the milk, and she poured it out. So we came back without milk. So I told her something. I said, \\\"You shouldn't do it. And don't worry the war will not last forever. I will remember you this.\\u201d And...and that's it. And I went back to work. When I came home about 6, 7 o'clock a Polish commandant from the Polish police with a mustache going up like a typical Pole, he stands there and waits for me. And he says to me, \\\"You're Naftali Salsitz?\\\" I said, \\\"Yes.\\u201d \\\"I want to tell you something. Tomorrow morning, we'll have to shoot you. We got orders from Farding to shoot you. So what should I do? \\\"You run away.\\u201d I thought he maked a joke. I said, \\\"Why?\\\" He said, \\\"Don't ask questions. I want you should live.\\u201d And he was known not to be a very tremendous Jew lover, so why does he tell it to me? So he said to me and I came and I told it to my friends what he told me. And everybody thought that I will escape and people were afraid because if I will escape, 10 others will be shot. So I said to my brother, I told him. He says, \\\"You know what' go speak to the Mayor.\\u201d The Mayor was a very good friend of my father, because my father was assistant mayor before the war. So I went to him and I told him this. Go to Farding and see if you can see he shouldn't. He said, \\\"I cannot go. I can't intervene for a Jew.\\u201d So what should I do? Escape. Everybody... Then he said to me, \\\"You know what? There is a man. His name is Halitski. He is the commandant of the Kripo, criminal policei, and he was a Ukrainian, but the Germans made his this. \\\"Are you on good terms with Hailitski?\\\" I said, \\\"Very good terms.\\u201d Now Halitski we were on good terms. Why? Because before the war, he was like a plain detective. And every holiday, he used to come to my father and he used to give him flour and sugar. You know just to be on good terms. So we were good to him. So I went to Hailitzski, and I said to Halitzski, if I can...you see, I could work. I had a pass to work. So I came to Halitzski, and he was a commandant of the Kripo, and I said to him, \\\"Can I talk to you?\\\" He said, \\\"Yes.\\u201d \\\"I have to tell you something.\\u201d He said, \\\"What do you want to tell me? That tomorrow you will be shot?\\\" I said, \\\"Yes.\\u201d \\\"I know about it.\\u201d He already knew about it. So I said, \\\"I came to you. Maybe you can help me. You were a friend with my father.\\u201d He said, \\\"Look, I cannot help you. You are a Jew. I cannot help you. But I want you should live.\\u201d \\\"So what should I do?\\\" \\\"Run away.\\u201d I said, \\\"You're the commandant of the Kripo should tell me to run away.\\u201d He said, \\\"Yes.\\u201d I said, \\\"They will hang 10 others.\\u201d He said, \\\"What do you care. You will save your life.\\u201d I said, \\\"What it is this, I have my brother here.\\u201d So he said, \\\"Take your brother and run away. I don't want to know about it. You run away.\\u201d And he cannot help. I came back. Everybody was afraid that I run away and then whose turn will be to be shot. Well, I didn't run away. I told them I will not because I don't want they should kill 10 for 1. The next day they went to work. I said goodbye to everybody. I put on very torn clothing. I took it from my friend, and I gave him my good clothing because if I be shot, let them have good shoes, good pants. And I came to my work, where I work in the warehouse. Like nothing happened. Two policeman standing there, two Polish policeman and they said to me, \\\"You come with me.\\u201d I said, \\\"Why?\\\" And I already knew what it is so I came to them. They took me to the Polish police. I come in to the Polish police. By the desk is sitting Patik was his name, the commandant who told me this. When he saw me, he got pale. He saw me that I didn't run away. And there in the corner was standing a shovel and they said, \\\"Take the shovel.\\u201d So I took the shovel and he looked at me and I walked out. They took me about 200 yards away and they...one of them with the rifle, the other with a rifle. They said, \\\"Start to dig.\\u201d \\\"Dig for what?\\\" \\\"Don't ask questions? Dig.\\u201d So I started to dig. It was already a foot high. I said, \\\"Well, I'm digging, but tell me why am I digging?\\\" \\\"Don't ask questions? Dig.\\u201d And I dug...I was already til here. \\\"What it was already quite deep, so I said, \\\"Tell me the truth. Who you going to shoot here?\\\" \\\"Don't ask.\\u201d \\\"It's me?\\\" They said, \\\"Yes.\\u201d There were two. I said, \\\"Why?\\\" He said, \\\"Don't ask questions.\\u201d So standing there two policemen with rifles, I am digging my own grave. Now what went through my mind? My whole life from the first minute I remember to the family this and that went through. People ask, \\\"What is the taste of death?\\\" Does somebody know the taste of death? Nobody knows the taste, because if somebody is dead he cannot tell you the story the taste of death. But I know the taste of death. But usually the taste of death takes a second, two seconds, and somebody's shot. But me the taste of death took more than an hour because [had to stay there in the grave and I knew I will be killed. This was the taste of death. I can tell you how the taste of death feels. Not only once, I can tell you seven times how the taste of death is from other episodes. So what should I do? Should I throw sand? How can I throw? One stands in this side, one stands in this side, with the rifles. So if I throw the other one, so I told the one, one was very vicious, so I said to him, \\\"You know I ask you one favor. If you know how to shoot. You're teaching me how to shoot. If you will shoot me, please kill me with one bullet. Shoot me through the head. I don't want...because I was thinking...I was afraid I will be buried alive. Until today when I have dreams, I have dreams from this day, and they shot me. They didn't kill me. I was buried alive. And then takes a long time to suffocate. What can I do? And I had an idea. And I said to that man, \\\"You're going to shoot me anyway. Why don't you go to bring Farding to tell Farding I want to see him. Farding was very shrewd. And I knew on every little thing, he wants to make out something of it. They said, \\\"I don't want to go to Farding. If I got to Farding, I don't shoot you. He will kill me. He's a vicious man. He was very bad for the Poles too. I said, \\\"Go and tell him. You have nothing to lose.\\u201d \\\"You run away.\\u201d I said, \\\"How can I run away? The other man stands here?\\\" He didn't want to do it. Farding had a secretary. Her name was Shusa Kotaleska. She was a girl from my town, and I knew her from before the war. So I told him, \\\"Go and tell Shusa Kotaleska, I want to talk to her.\\u201d They didn't want and one agree. He said, \\\"I will bring Shusa Kotaleska.\\u201d They brought Shusa Kotaleska. She was Polish. When she saw me, she started to cross herself and said, \\\"Oh Jesus, What's going on?\\\" I said, \\\"I don't know. They're going to shoot me.\\u201d She says, \\\"Why?\\\" I said, \\\"I don't know.\\u201d I said, \\\"I need a favor. Go tell Fardring,.is Farding in the office?\\\" She said, \\\"Yes.\\u201d \\\"Go tell Farding I want to see him. I have very important things to tell him.\\u201d And I knew this would be the very...uh...things he will...\\u201d \\\"I cannot go to Farding. You know him...\\u201d I said, \\\"Go.\\u201d She went. Comes back in a few mnutes, and she told Farding...she said I want to tell him something very important. So she comes back and she said he wants to see you. I went back, so the policeman didn't have a choice, and they with the rifles on both side, go up to Fardring. Fardring comes out of the office. In the office thre were about 10 girls. He said, \\\"Hey, verfluchter Jude, you there. You're crazy. He wasn't my friend anymore. You, what you coming to see me? So I said, \\\"I have something very important to tell you.\\u201d \\\"Alright, what is it?\\\" I said, \\\"Well, I cannot speak to you when all the people are here. I want to go in the other room.\\u201d He took out his revolver and he started to curse me. He said, \\\"Jude. Turn around. Going to shoot you like a dog.\\u201d So I started to...you see, in this time, I was very calm. You see by me, if I am very scared, I will become very calm. And I was...and I started to smile. I said, \\\"You threaten me to shoot in there. I dug my own grave. And you tell me...so here at least I'll be shot under a roof.\\u201d So he . Alright. He took me to the other room. And he said, \\\"What do you want to tell me? Want to tell me that the Jews have money? What you tell me?\\\" I said, \\\"No.\\u201d Said, \\\"What do you want to tell me?\\\" \\\"You're going to shoot me. I know you like Bohnenkaffee. You like coffee beans.\\u201d You see my brother who was with me...he was known. He was specialist in roasting coffee beans. And before the war we used to roast our own coffee beans, and it was the best coffee beans we made. And he knew about it. And he didn't have too much coffee beans in the warehouse, and he needed it. And by Germans, coffee beans was everything. I had hidden by a peasant 100 kilo coffee beans before the war. Not roasted, green coffee beans. And if my brother will roast it, it is fresh. It's very good. I had it hidden. We never took it out. Figured maybe someday we'll need it. I said, \\\"If you let me go, I give you coffee beans.\\u201d As I told him this, he got red. He started to squeak with his squeaky voice. His...his shaved head started to perspire and looked at me with his eyes like a pig and he...he went to me. He slapped me in the face. He said, \\\"You are bribing me?\\\" I said, \\\"Who's bribing you? I don't bribe you. I will give you coffee. You can shoot me later. What's the difference. You can always shoot me.\\u201d So then later he quieted down. He said, \\\"Where will you take the coffee beans? You want to say that the Jews in Rzeszow have coffee beans because there were still 2,000 Jews. I said, \\\"No, I don't even know the Jews in Rzeszow. I know peasants I know storekeepers. They used to buy from me before the war. They're in the stores. I will go and buy.\\u201d \\\"Okay. How much coffee beans will you give me?\\\" I said, \\\"How much is my life worth?\\\" So he said, \\\"50 kilo.\\u201d I said, \\\"50 kilo. In the whole general government you cannot have 50 kilo coffee beans. From where?\\\" So I said, \\\"I'll give you 5 kilo\\\" \\\"10 Kilo\\\" Well, we bargained and bargained. Then we agreed on 25 kilo. I said, \\\"25 kilo.\\u201d \\\"When can you bring it to me? Tomorrow?\\\" \\\"What do you mean, tomorrow? Where can I buy 25 kilo?\\\" Then later I spoke to him like an equal because he already made a deal with me. So I said, I have to go and buy. I will buy 10 here, I will buy 10 here. I will put it together. I need a Passierschein signed. I need a pass to go.\\u201d He called in Shusha Kotaleska, \\\"Make him out a pass.\\u201d And this pass I have. \\\"How long you want the pass? For a week?\\\" I said, \\\"Oh, No. I need the pass at least for 6 months.\\u201d So he started to jump again. Well, anyway, he gave me a pass for a month. Then he said to go out from the ghetto. I said, \\\"No. I need a pass to Rzeszow.\\u201d Because I had to go to Rzeszow to other stores. And then later when he agreed to Rzeszow. I said, \\\"Rzeszow and the whole state.\\u201d Because I wanted to be free. So he wrote down in the whole state. And this Passieschein I have. He gave it to me and he wrote down in the book 25 kilo coffee beans. Then I asked him...yes...sorry.....he said to me, \\\"I hope you will not escape before you give me the coffee beans.\\u201d So I told him, \\\"I will not escape because if I would lie to escape I would have escaped yesterday. I knew yesterday I'll be shot.\\u201d So he said, \\\"You knew this. Who told you this?\\\" \\\"Well, if somebody wanted to save my life, I wouldn't tell you now who told me this.\\u201d \\\"You knew yesterday and you didn't escape? Why didn't you escape, he asked. So I said, \\\"How can I escape when I know that if I escape you will kill 10 others. So why should you kill 10 Jews when you had only | Jew. He said, \\\"You want to say you didn't escape because you wanted to save the other nine?\\\" So I said, \\\"Tell me, Herr Landkommissar, wouldn't you do this for your friends?\\\" I said, \\\"You would do this for your friends too. I did it for my friends.\\u201d He didn't say anything. So he said, \\\"Okay, okay, okay.\\u201d Then later I asked him another thing. I said, \\\"Now, if we made a deal, tell me why did you tell the police to shoot me.\\u201d So he said, \\\"Yesterday, you went for milk.\\u201d I said, \\\"Yes.\\u201d \\\"And you had an argument with this woman.\\u201d I said, \\\"Yes.\\u201d \\\"And you threatened a woman, said 'You are a communist and when the Russians will come in, you will be the first one to shoot her. You told her this.' Because this what she told her boyfriend, and they told him. So I asked him, Herr Landkommissar, Do you think that I am so stupid that I should, in a public place, even if I would think of it, do you think I would be so stupid to tell it openly?\\\" So he said, \\\"No, I don't think so you so stupid,\\\" and he laughed. And I walked home. But the main thing is after this, and I told you the story about the coffee beans. The main thing when older people...yal...so...the Germans if there was a grave open, the grave could never be left open without killing somebody, so he went out to the policeman. They were waiting with the secretaries. He said, \\\"You know Vinoski\\\" There was a Pole Vinoski. \\\"You go and bring him and shoot him and bury him there.\\u201d And he said to me, \\\"You wait because you'll be the one to bury him. So they went and brought Vinoski. Why? And they shot him, and I covered him. The shots were heard. Vinoski he shot because the day before Farding had a little dog. And Vinoski went through and the dog bit him. So Vinoski complained, said the dog bit him. Because the dog bit him and he complained, he had to be killed. So they brought Vinoski. They killed him, and I covered him. And I went back with the shovel to the office, and there was sitting this Pappek, this commander. And when he saw me putting back this...uh...shovel, he looked at me. He couldn't understand it. Here he hears a shot. I had to be killed and here I am but knew he knew I wasn't shot. All the boys who worked heard the shots, so they were sure I was shot. So there happened a thing that I cannot forget this thing. So I was waiting til they will come back from work. And when they came back from work, this drill sergeant drilled them that they walked like a army with the shovels on their back, and when I was standing there on the steps and they saw me from a distance standing, they were so thrilled, so happy that I'm alive that this Lampel gave an order to them and they say Achtung which means attention, and they told him...it's like a review, and they start...and he told them to march with their feet like the Germans, you know, like the , and they started to march through me and everybody looked at me that I'm alive. And then later everybody started to hug me and they kissed me that I'm alive. This moment every time I tell this story, I break down because you cannot imagine that they knew that I was shot and I'm alive. So this is the story from the coffee beans. We worked in the camp, and I went every day to work. And there were episodes and episodes and episodes.  We don't have time. Okay. So. Escape. Okay. So I will not tell you those episodes because they killed once 400 people. We were there, but this is not for now. We were there till the 18th of November. And it started to be cold. And we knew that we will be liquidated. The reason why we knew that we will be liquidated when we took apart the houses, the houses were from logs...from beams. So we cut the beams, and he always told us, \\\"Well, you better put them in a safe place because for the winter you will need them for fuel.\\u201d Then later one day he came and he said, \\\"There will come Poles with papers and we should give them out the wood.\\u201d And when we saw that the wood has to be given away, so we knew that we will not be there in the winter. So I started to prepare the escape. As I had papers to go out. So I started to speak to each one to convince him to escape. Some wanted, some didn't have money, some didn't have a place; some were afraid. Somehow I went to their acquaintances, and I made contacts and I tried to have...and I wanted to live the day when Farding will come in and to take us away, and from the hundred, not one will be left. And this what I wanted. Later, we will be shot. But to see him that we run away. Well anyway, I tried and I went and I convinced and the commandant was very much against me...the Jewish commandant, because he couldn't escape. And he didn't want to make a commotion because he knew that the rest will be killed if somebody will escape. So we were there until November and I was close... already had 55 people to escape. I needed 45 more to escape. This was the 18th of November. It started to be cold. I come home from work. Who waits outside? Poppek. This polish commandant with the long mustache. He waits outside. He calls me out back, he says, \\\"Listen, you didn't listen to me last time. But you were lucky.\\u201d Later, he find out how I told him how I saved myself. \\\"You were lucky. This night we got orders to surround the ghetto with the German police and to take you away.\\u201d And I didn't know to kill on the spot, but to take you way. This was enough. I said, \\\"I hope.... He said, \\\"I hope this time you will listen to me, and you will save yourself.\\u201d So I said, \\\"Yes, I believe you.\\u201d I went in and I started to tell it to our people. The one who wanted to escape believed me. The other didn't believe me. There started to be a commotion and this and that. And I begged them, and you could see everybody prepared a knapsack ready to escape. Meanwhile, this commandant took two policeman, put them by the doors, not to let out nobody. But so happens that the two policemen were my friends who we were together and they were one of the escapees...who wanted to escape. So they said to him, \\\"Don't put us in because we gonna to escape.\\u201d They went out and I went to see. \\\"Go, go, go, go,\\\" and I said, \\\"I will be the last one.\\u201d I was waiting there til about...uh...2, 3 o'clock in the morning. Nothing happened. And I started to think, \\\"Maybe it's not true, and maybe they went away and the rest will be shot.\\u201d But I waited. And about 3 in the morning one of our boys came in and they said, \\\"Well, it's bad. We are surrounded.\\u201d But I didn't escape. I was there. I go out. Two Polish policemen were standing. The German policemen were on the other side. And I go into one...I go next to one and L...I knew him. His name was Yashemik. And I go to him and I said, \\\"What...what you doing here?\\\" He said, \\\"Well, we surround the camp.\\u201d I said, \\\"You mean I cannot go out.\\u201d He said, No.\\u201d I said, \\\"But I can go out.\\u201d He said, \\\"How?\\\" \\\"If you turn around, I can go away.\\u201d Before this there was a fence. I went and I loosened a few boards from the fence because I wanted to be ready. So he turns around the way I said it. And I was there with my friend. I pulled my friend, and we jumped through the road into the fence. He didn't say anything. I was there in this yard and later we had to go over the road. There were German with lights. But anyway, I escaped. From the 100, 55 escaped. From the 55, 30 were caught the next 2, 3 days by  03  Okay. So. You know, you say slow down, it reminds me a story. My mother used to knit, to make sweaters, with a needle...uh...  Crochet. She didn't have too much wool then. So she crocheted it very fast. So they asked her, \\\"Why you rushing things.\\u201d She said, \\\"I wanted to finish before I'm out of wool.\\u201d So the same thing. I want to tell you the story before we're out of time.  Well, anyway. Okay. So we started to be in very bad [shape]. Instead of go[ing] together to do something against the Germans, to destroy something, to blow up trains, our most energy was to be on the watch for the peasants and for the AK. In the book, I'm describing episodes practically from so many who were killed, but now it's no time..  So I will give you for instance one episode. I find out that one of my friends who went with me to school for seven years. His name was Fascick Augustin. His father was a very good friend of my father. They were very wealthy peasants. They had an estate. But his father was the president of all kinds of monopoly from the Polish government. Like kerosene, salt, matches. This was Polish monopoly, and we had to buy it through him. So they became very friendly. Even he was on the board of the same bank as my father was, and they became very friendly. And with this boy I was friendly. We went to school, was sitting next to each other. I find out that this boy...this Fascick Augustin became commandant from the AK in our section. Now, I don't have to explain now the AK. You know it, but if there it needs some explanation, this was the underground which was directed from the London government in exile. And AK means in Polish \\\"Armia Krajowa\\\". It means the home army. So when I find out, here the Ak is killing us and Fascick is my friend and he's the commandant, the best thing would be to go to him to see if he wouldn't take me in with my group. This was the time when our leader was killed, and I became the commandant from our group. So I said I will come to him and maybe I can convince him to take us in. Not only that we will be able to fight the Germans, but we will be safe from them that they shouldn't kill us. I sent over a girl who belonged to the organization. This is the woman whom I brought over last year. And we made an appointment, and he wanted to see me. He prepared there a place, a meeting place. We came to the meeting place. This is complicated, how and what, when. But, anyway, I came there with my brother. And he was very happy to see me. The meeting place was made in a stable between the section of cows and the section of horses and there where the animals ate the hay, this was removable. We could go in that nobody could see. They cut the locks and this was a small place about, I would say about 8 by 12. And then we came in, and they were very happy to see us. He grabbed me and kissed me. He said we will kill Germans. We'll survive the war. And the next day he went to...so he said right away...we were infested with lice. In the woods, we didn't have no changes. So he said, \\\"Take off those rags.\\u201d And he brought me fresh underwear. I put on the fresh underwear. My brother put on the fresh underwear. And then they brought us food. Then we made plans. And then his...he had an older brother. The older brother was Yashik was his name. It was a little complicated. Stashik and Yashik. There were two brothers. And his brothers also was in the underground, so he came in and he said to me, \\\"You know what? There is somebody who wants to sell a revolver. You want to buy it?\\\" I said, \\\"Sure, Fred.\\u201d Because I was ready to buy. \\\"Go and buy it.\\u201d And he went and he came back about an hour later, and he said, \\\"He doesn't want money. He wants to have a suit or two suits.\\u201d I said, \\\"No problem. I have two suits still left by somebody in town. I will send for it, and I will give him. Bring me the revolver.\\u201d He went. He came back. He said, \\\"Oh, he's not home.\\u201d And when he came in, I saw him holding the hand in his right pocket. And I had there a knapsack that I brought, and I had there shoes, not boots, shoes and short, half shoes. And I didn't need in the woods . I said to him, \\\"You know what? I have those shoes,\\\" and I dragged them, \\\"I don't need. It's the same size as you. Why don't you take the shoes?\\\" So he went and he opened the knapsack with the left hand. And his hand was filled in the pack...I didn't suspect him, but some intuition....I don't know. Then I asked him...he used to be contributor to the Polish underground newspaper and every Tuesday the newspaper came out, and this was a Tuesday. I asked him, \\\"Tell me, Yasha, today the newspaper came out. What is there news.\\u201d Because from the underground newspaper, we could find out more than from the German newspaper. \\\"What is the news.\\u201d He said, \\\"I forgot.\\u201d To me, it was something. He is a contributor and I ask him about the news, but he says I forgot. He opens the knapsack with the left hand. He doesn't take...so intuition, and I was in this time already in a bundle of straw with my brother covered with a military blanket because we want to rest. Something told me and I lifted up the blanket and I took out my revolver. I always had my revolver with me even if I slept. I had a belt, and on the belt I had a revolver, a hatchet, hand grenades, a flashlight, the whole arsenal I had around me. So I took out the revolver, and I lifted the blanket and I had a long barrel revolver, and I lifted it he shouldn't see that I'm holding and I cocked the revolver. I held it straight to him. In this moment and he was still standing in front of me holding his hand in the package, in this moment, my brother didn't know what I'm doing. He wanted to go down. He opened the blanket. And he saw and he left me exposed with my revolver pointed to him. The minute he saw it he walked out. Then I said to my brother, \\\"What did you do?\\\" And he couldn't...he said to me, \\\"Why didn't you trust them. Those are people want to save us.\\u201d \\\"Well, it was done. It's too late.\\u201d About 10 minutes after he left, we heard knocks on the wall. Later, we find out, those knocks were a signal for him to do something. Because this was near the road, and on the road was a German patrol. So they had to let them and this later we found out, to let them know that the German patrol was far away that he could start to shoot. But we didn't know about it. But when he saw me ready, he walked out. The next day we didn't know what to do, how to face them. We were embarrassed. But they didn't mention anything. I didn't mention anything. They went to town. He brought me  medicine. He brought me this. About 5 o'clock, they came in and he brought a German newspaper and he wanted I should translate him about the front, where the front is. We looked, we had a little kerosene lamp. My brother started to eat, and I looked in the paper and he said to me, \\\"Well, I lost something. Why don't you lend me your flashlight.\\u201d I took off the flashlight, and I gave it to him. Soon as I gave him the flashlight it became dark. He turned off the kerosene lamp. And as it became dark, I hear a shots. One, two, three, four. I didn't know what, when. And I fell down. I fell down. I was [old you see??], and my head started to spin around. In this moment...you see, I am telling you this...this takes a few seconds, a few minutes maybe. But this took a split of a second and I fell. And I fell down. I said, \\\"This is it.\\u201d They took us in to be shot. But I'm glad that somebody shot me from behind because I was always afraid to be caught by the Germans alive. I didn't want they should torture me. So we always had a rule in our unit that if the last bullet we cannot shoot, the last bullet we had to leave for ourself. But here, I fell down. I said, \\\"Fine, this is it. We went through so much. The whole family doesn't live. Everybody I loved doesn't live. It's enough.\\u201d And while I was laying there, I was thinking...but I'm still alive. Why should he shoot me? Why shouldn't I kill him? Laying on the floor, somehow I took out my revolver, and it was dark, and I wanted to put in my index finger to pull the trigger, it was like a piece of wood. I got a bullet, he shot me, I got three bullets in my neck and went through. L..then when I caught myself I got a bullet here, and the bullet traveled through the finger, ripped the finger apart, but didn't touch the bone. So when I wanted to put in this finger, I couldn't because it didn't move. Now [i.e. today] in winter, I cannot move this finger. In winter, it gets stiff. But during the day 2?.. Right away, I had enough. I put in the other finger. I put in this finger. And it was dark. I shot once in the air, and I had a big caliber. So from the shot, I could see from the glare of it, and I could see this brother standing in the doorway because it was very small where they made the extension the door to go in. So I still saw him. It went so fast that I still saw him standing pointing at his revolver to me. It went so fast. So when I shot once, I saw him. Right away, I shot him the third to him and right the third time. By the third time because I didn't know that I will hit him with the first bullet. When I shot him the first time I saw him already laying stretched out. With my second bullet, one I shot in the air, with the second bullet, I pierced his heart and I killed him. And by the third bullet, I saw him stretched out. When his brother saw what happened because he saw by the glare the same thing as I and his brother start to shot to my brother. When he saw what happened he ran out. And this was an emergency door. When he run out I shot after him, and I hit him in the spine, and he fell down. Now we are naked. My brother didn't know what's going on. So he started to yell to them, \\\"What you playing with firecrackers? Because he couldn't understand, it went so fast. So I said to him, \\\"No.\\u201d And we had our things on the attic, and there was no ladder to the attic. But we had to climb through the beams. Took the revolver in my teeth, I started to climb and I wanted to take boots. I wanted to take the medicine, and also the most important thing I wanted to take, I had a diary what my sister started the first day of the war. And every day she wrote in the diary. But because we came to him, I figured I will be able to sit and I will enter for a few days. So I wanted to get the diary. But in the dark, scared, you [are] hit, I don't know where I'm hit. So when I took one boot out of the 2? I took this and that. I left everything. I jumped out. I called my brother. He wasn't there anymore. What happened? He find a door. He ran out the door. And his friends, there  03  Okay. Alright. Before I left this camp. The first day of Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, no, the second day of Rosh Hashanah. The Jews in 1942, they killed in our town and(?) Novasans they got together people from Rzeszow who wanted to run away to Hungary. There was a place,Bokhnia, that they made false papers for Jews and Poles, and they went to Hungary, and Hungary was easier to survive. And they caught those people, they didn't catch those people. They caught this girl who was their runner, and but once I'm telling you this, I want to tell you about this girl. I think she should be remembered.  See, this girl was the runner, and she was caught on the list of 45 people with false papers, that they should run away to Romania, and she was caught. And she was tortured. She was killed. The Germans knew those people because they had the documents. And they arrested those people, and they brought them to us in jail when we were in the camp. During the night I find out about it, and I went to the jail, and through a window, they told me those things what happened to them, that this girl was caught. But there is a other list of 200 that she had to prepare documents. They didn't know if they got the list. But if they got the list, they will pick up the 200 too. What was necessary is to go to Rzeszow which was 31 kilometers and go to Rzeszow and to warn the people that they are arrested and they should do something and to hide. So soon as they told me, I told...I took the wagon with the horse what Farding gave me to bring the old junk to Rzeszow and I always had it ready packed because I never knew when I will have to go in a hurry. This was at night, and I took the horse and I went to Rzeszow, 31 kilometers, because even if the Germans would catch me, I had a pass to go and I went officially because I had to bring those things. So I went to Rzeszow and I came into the ghetto with these things, and I had to notify someone I know to notify that they were arrested. And they are worrying about the 200 other people. And they told me who to contact. I contact this person, and he notified the 200 people they should go into hiding who were on the list. But what the Germans did, they came and they couldn't find nobody from the 200, so they took 200 other Jews, and they brought them to us with them and in this day, the second day of Rosh Hashanah, they killed in Novasans(??). this village not far from us, they killed 400 Jews. They brought Jews from Hutta Kaminski (??), from ?? . Young girls, beautiful girls, Jews who had scabs, cuts, and they reported they cannot go to work, so they took them and they killed them. Now there are so many details, but it is not for now. But you ask me about the other details.  So when they killed the 400 people, I became very hysterical and I went into a Polish woman, was very friendly with my father. This was the woman I gave all the merchandise when I was left, when they took away our people to Rzeszow, so I gave her the merchandise over the fence. So I went to her and started to cry very hysterical. I said, \\\"I want to live. I want to live. Do something. Do something.\\u201d She said, \\\"What can I do.\\u201d She said, \\\"What can I do?\\\" I said, \\\"I need papers. I want to run away.\\u201d She said, \\\"I can help you out with it. lama very good friend of the Monseigneur, from the Catholic Church...in Polish Dekan (dean). I will ask him if he can give you papers.\\u201d So I told her, \\\"You know, I had a friend who went with me to school. His name was ? . He looked a little like me. And he went me to school. And he was killed in 1939. He was in the Polish army. He was killed. Maybe he can give me his paper, and then if there would be a picture we look very much alike.\\u201d She went to the Monseigneur, and the Monseigneur gave me a birth certificate which I have with me, which they made a copy of it. And he gave me this birth certificate. With this birth certificate, I could show that that I was ? . So through this girl, she was a runner between two groups. So she went to the group which was farther away from my town and she made a contact and with her I went and I was accepted and she introduced me to their commandant, she was very friendly with and he liked me. He took me in, and so then I became a member of this group. And this was a very important group because this group was not like from people who belonged to the underground, and they were staying in their homes. This was a group who was a combat group in the woods. And I was very happy to be with them because with them, we destroyed police stations, we blew up trains. We did so many things because they were a force. You see when I was in the woods as a Jew, I only could go out when there was a blizzard, when there was a rain. I was a fugitive. Everybody would give me out. I have to hide the gun. But when I was with them, I was a hero. I came out to the village with the rifle open. I put in a beret with a Polish eagle. I put on a band with a white and red as a Polish patriot. The girls even waited for us, to kiss us. The people used to bring us vodka and food. I was the same man, fighting the same enemy. But here because I was a Jew, I was fugitive. And here because I was Pole, I was a hero. So with them, it gave me the opportunity to take, and every night there was some action because they were so strong and they could do it. And with them I had the opportunity to do it.  03  Okay. But this way if you can make a decision that is a few from the woods, I would like to tell you a few episodes how we made...uh...a  Right. I want to go back when we were quite strong yet in the woods with our Jewish group. Now, our leader was a Jew who was forester, which is very unusual for a Jew to be this profession. Was a very intelligent man, but mostly he was a forester because he specialized in artificial raising [of] fish. He had artificial lakes...not artificial...had man made lakes, and they raised carps, and this belonged to a very rich Jew in Rzeszow and his name was Bank, and the forester's name was Pinva. Well, anyway, and Froelich, Pinya Froelich, and he was the organizer of this group who was there before I came and he still was our leader. Then later he was killed, and also it was a very unfortunate thing how he was killed. Uh...He could be saved, but...uh... because the men who surrounded the house were peasants from his village, and he didn't to use his gun, he didn't want to shoot, because they were his friends. They were people who he knew all his life, so he didn't want to harm them. But nevertheless, they took him with his wife, and they took him to a barn and they killed him. After this I became, I took over his place, and I became the leader. Now, we wanted to do something against the Germans. It was very hard for us because our main thing was to protect ourselves from the Poles who were so hostile towards us. There was, as I told you before, the Poles used to get skim milk for free, but there was a factory not far from the woods when in, a milk factory, and all the peasants used to bring their milk and there they produced cheese, butter, and this was sent to Germany. And from the whole section, all the Poles used to bring their milk there. So we thought that we want to disrupt these things. I had there a man that I knew, and he was working there. And he gave me all the information when the work starts, stops, who is the guard, and how. So one dark night six of us went over there and we disarmed the guard, and we went in and we destroyed the whole place. It took us about an hour. We broke all the equipment, and there was special equipment brought from Germany, and all the machines where they used to produce the cheese and the butter, and everything was destroyed. After everything was destroyed we packed our knapsacks full of cheese, that we had it enough for about 2, 3 months and we left. The next day the Germans came and they surrounded the village, and they arrested some Poles. They accused them that they did some sabotage, but then later they let them out because they had proof that some partisans, they didn't know that we did it, but some partisans came and they did the damage. And it was quite a big damage. It was a big help for the peasants, because for months they didn't have to give the milk. They didn't know what to do with the milk because there was not a facility to manufacture the cheese and the butter. But then later, they rebuilt it and it by them 3 months and they started again. But this was a very big satisfaction what we did. Also, once a week they collected the cows from the peasants. Each calf when it was born, they put in a ear ring on the calf, and this was registered. And eventually they had to give over the cow to the Germans and they also had an evidence how much milk the peasant has to bring in from the cow. They delivered the cows, once a week they were driven or they were taken to the railroad station so we always waited when they were taken to the railroad station they chased...not by cars, but on foot. So we waited on the edge of the forest and we lured always one or two or three cows into the woods, and we took them away. So this was a very big help for us because in the winter, usually, we sold some cows and then we we killed one so we had meat enough for weeks. So this was also a way of trying to do some damage. And, there was an other case that we were in a place that there was a search for Poles, but not for Jews anymore, but the search for Poles for taking the Poles to Germany. And we were in the attic and we were hidden in the hay, and they searched even the attic, but they didn't find us, and they left the house and they took the owner from this place that we were hiding. He didn't know we were there. And then he escaped, so in the evening a Polish policeman came to take him back. And we saw it, so we waited for him outside, and we killed him. We took away his gun, his rifle, his bicycle. So those were things that we tried to do as much as possible. But when I joined the AK, then it was a different story because the Ak was openly more loyal, in the village they were open and they could do a lot of things. They were very strong. They received drops from planes, ammunition, money, medicine, and guns, everything, from England. They used to drop in special assigned places in the woods, and they had all those things. So we did other things like there was a police station in Glogel for instance. So we surrounded the police station one night and we disarmed the policemen. They were not killed, but we took away everything they had there, rifles and guns, revolvers. We took it away, and we completely demolished the police station. Then there was a very important railroad line which went from Rzeszow to Senjisuv (??). This was not far from the forest what I described you before. So a few times those railroad tracks  were blown up, and the supplies... It was not so much the supplies, but in this time the Germans started to pull out a large quantity of soldiers in the army from the eastern part in Poland. And the railroads were blown up with the soldiers, and this we did about 5, 6 times, those railroad lines, which was easy to do because the railroad lines were not actually guarded so much and we were not afraid for peasants. There was once an ammunition dump and not far from Rzeszow...before Rzeszow...were big forest, dense forests. So once we went over there and this was everything with the Polish AK and we blew up one ammunition depot there. The Germans later retaliated, but this group we knew we did it, so the same night we disappeared in the other section and actually, they didn't catch nobody. But they retaliated towards the local population. They didn't know exactly who did it. Now one episode I want to tell you this is what we did on our own. But I have to go back to that camp where we were after the destruction, after taking away our people from our town when we were in this labor camp in Kolbuszowa when we destroyed the houses of the ghetto. So we were working there, a Sharfuehrer came from the SS with a Polish boy, which he was his adjudant, his helper. And this Sharfuehrer was very vicious and we knew about him that he killed and he beat and always he was always drunk. He always was red in his face and nose was like...from a drunkard. And he came to us while we were working, and it so happened that I loaded in this time some furniture. And I had a mirror in my hand, a big large mirror. He said to me, \\\"Look in this mirror.\\u201d So I looked in his mirror. He said, \\\"Look what good cannon fodder you are, because this what you will be.\\u201d And I didn't answer, because you couldn't answer this man. And he came to see what we are doing, and there was one of my friends. His name was Motek Weiss. He was from Krakow, a very nice boy, fragile boy. And he said to his adjudant, his name was Volstick, a Polish boy from the neighboring village and he said to him to take a 2 by 4 and to start to beat this boy. And he started to beat him. He fell down. We put him on his feet. He beat him again. And he beat him so that he just was a piece of black flesh lying on the floor. And later we brought him back to our barracks, and the same day he died. And just he did it for fun. Uh...Later, he pointed out I should go with him. So I thought he was going to give me the same treatment as with this boy, but I couldn't say anything so I went with them and he said to me that he wants to get some brass. He needs brass. And we had brass from the old houses, from old candlesticks, and in one room in this warehouse we kept only brass. I took him to show him the brass. While we went there to see the brass, we went through a room where there was paper collected. Now they were mostly old books. You know, by Jews, we don't throw away books. Books were always saved. We put them on the attic of the synagogue and if it was full, so we took the books into the cemetery and we wrapped them in prayer shawls, and they were buried like human beings. So in this time when we cleaned out the attic from the synagogue, there was full of old books. Books that were hundred, two hundred years old. They were yelllow. We piled them (up). We put them in this room. It was stacks till the attic. And he came in and he start, he always had such a hoarse voice like a drunkard, and he asked me what's here. I told him paper, books. \\\"What kind of books?\\\" I told him, \\\"Religious books. Jewish books.\\u201d And the books were stacked on both sides of the room that in the middle was just a passageway. And from the top there was a little window. And the window, through the window, rays of the sun came in. And because there were books, old books there was a lot of dust, and the rays...the ray illuminated the dust that you could see through this window came like a column of light on the one spot. And in this moment, it reminded me that this column is the same column as God showed to the Israelites when they left Egypt so they should know their way in the desert. So in the evening, in the night, he had a column of light; in the day a column of dust. And this was to show them the way how to go. So in this moment, I remembered from the Bible, and I said, \\\"This is the same column as God had it when the Israelites left Egypt.\\u201d And this Scharfuehrer s, did everything what God forbid probably the way he killed and he saw the spot from the ray on the floor, and he stood in the spot and he looked up and he started to yell with his hoarse voice. And he said, \\\"Yehovah, Yehovah. Wo bist Du.\\u201d Means, \\\"Yehovah, Yehovah, Where are you? Yehovah, Warum hilfst Du nicht Deine Kinder?. \\\"Yehovah, why don't you help your children?\\\" And he looked at me, and he said to me, \\\"You see, Your Yehovah is old. Your Yehovah is dead. He cannot even hear what I am saying. Now, here you are. What we are doing to the Jews, and he doesn't do anything.\\u201d And he spat on the floor, and he walked out. In this moment, I was sure that God would punish him. That God will make him lame or something will kill him. After all, he said something bad about my God. Maybe I had doubts of my God in this time that he didn't help us, but I think I had a right to have doubts because I was a Jew and I believed in God. But he was a stranger, and he had no right to insult my God, and I was very angry. And I said to myself, \\\"I have to survive the war. Even if I have to kill this guy, because he insulted my God.\\u201d This was in this time when I was in the camp. Naturally, there was a thing that I knew that it could never happen. How could I do it? But..still I had in my mind. Two years later...was it two years later?...almost two years later, a year and a half later I was in the woods, I found out that this man., this Sharfuehrer, is in charge of Polish farms in the section where it was Przeworsk (?). Przeworsk, the section I described before, belonged to the SS and he was in charge of the farms. Because they didn't want to have Poles in this section, so they chased out all the Poles because this was where they perfected the V-1, V-2 rockets. But they wanted to have something from the farms, so the farmers used to go over there to work, and at night they went away. And he was in charge of it. And I found out about it, and I was told also that every Friday, Saturday and Sunday, they have like drinkings with girls, playing cards, dancing in the substation from this Przeworsk camp. Now we had in our group two Jews who came from this vicinity. One was a manager in an estate, which knew very well the village and there was another one from this vicinity. And also the father of the girl who helped me join the A, her name was Stashka Hodora. She married later and her married...marriage name is Bargike . She lives now in Warsaw, and 2 years ago I brought her over for a visit. So this Stashka's father used to go and he used to work in the house where they had those gatherings every Saturday and every Sunday. And he was like a worker there. He took care of the horses. He took care of... So through him I find out that he takes care on all those things on this farm. And he told me and I had in my mind that something has to be done. And I approached our group a few times and I said, this was an obsession with me that Thad to do something towards him, but always my friends told me, \\\"We cannot do it. We're not strong enough and to go and make a raid on SS group and we will be killed.\\u201d And I gave up the idea. When I left the AK and I came back, I still find out that through this Hodora, that he works there and this man is still there in charge. Then I find out that not far from us there was a group of Russian partisans. You see, the front came closer to us, so also the partisans came closer to us. I find out where they are, and I went over to them, and I introduced myself that I am a leader from a partisan group. I didn't tell them that we were Jews because we never knew how they will accept us, and there were a lot between the Russians...there were a lot of Ukrainians also. And so | didn't say that we were Jews, but we were group and I have an idea that I want they should help us. And I told them that I want to make a raid on  04  So I want to tell you...I want to tell you about this last night. If we will have time, we'll come back. The last night I was back with my with my group. There were only six left of us. So I went to the same peasant Hodora what he gave me the information, and his daughter was... So I went to see how the situation is. Because the front was already by us. The Germans went back and back, and we knew that we could hear the detonations and the shootings and came closer and closer. When we came to Hodora that night nobody was home. The house was empty. It was open. It was empty. The cows were not there. So we understood. Because they are afraid, the front comes close...near, so they went into the woods because to be safer. Nobody was there, so we decided to stay over the next day and the next night we'll see what to do. Now there was in  the barn was full with hay because this was after the harvest, so we buried ourselves in the hay. During the night we could hear that a unit of calvary is going through the road, and the road was very close to the house because you could hear horses, the chains ringing. And then a few came in the yard and they came into the barn where we were hiding. And they started to take out hay for the horses. Now we didn't know how much hay they would take out because if there could be a lot of horses, they could empty the barn, and then later we'll be exposed, but as they took out the hay, we buried ourselves more and more and more. Then later we heard them speaking that this night they will go. Then later we came out and they were already gone, so I said to my friend, Leiba, I said, \\\"We cannot stay here because this is the territory that the German front is establishing. We have to go over to the east and to cross over probably the Russians  are on the side.\\u201d So we went to a place where there was a clearing. This side the Germans were, and the other side the Russians. And we were...this was a clearing. So I said, \\\"We have to move through the clearing.\\u201d So he found a little brook and with this brook we started to crawl to go over to the other side. But somebody spotted us and they started to shot on us from both sides. You see when one side started to shoot, so the other side started to shoot. So we knew here are the Germans, and here are the Russians and we're on the middle. We jumped out from this little brook and they were haystacks and we buried ourselves in the haystacks. Then from a distance we saw a horse with two riders on it galloping, going about 200 yards away from us, coming from one side of the forest to the other. Now this man, he was from a village, and he said to me, \\\"I cannot go out and ask him what's going on because they know me. But they don't know you. Go and ask them. And I know those peasants.\\u201d He even told me the name. His name is Poslusne. He said, \\\"I know them because they are from my village. I even recognize the horse because I sold them the horse before I left the village.\\u201d And he recognized. Well, I thought he knows. I came out from the haystack and I run after them, and I started to yell, Panie Poslusne. And this was at night and they, finally, they heard me. And they slowed down. When they slowed I came closer to them. Now I saw it wasn't Poslusne. It was two SS man, on one horse. And this was from this unit of the horses what they sent them over as a patrol to go to the other side to find out what's going on. Here I'm standing there close to them. The liberation is almost here. Freedom is almost here. And I am standing. And they jumped out from the horse, both of them, took out their revolvers, pointing at me, and I looked like a peasant. I was barefoot. And I had a jacket, a long jacket covered, and underneath the jacket I had my arsenal. I had two revolvers, with a bayonet, with a hatchet, with a flashlight, bullets, everything I had underneath, but it was covered. And when they jumped down, I didn't know what to say...what to start. I couldn't show them I speak German, because Polish people didn't speak German. So I started to yell and to cry in Polish and I told them what will I do. My wife and my children went to the woods with the cows. Now they say the Russians are coming and there are rumors the Russians are raping the women and killing the children, taking away the cows. What will I do? What will I do? Please help me. Help me. And I said to them, \\\"We are four or five years with the Germans. Nothing happened to us.  04  Well, I don't know...  I beg your pardon.  Okay.  First, we had the Jewish group. Right?  The AK. Yes. With the AK, I was quite long. I was a few months with AK.  Was the Russian. But you see, with the Russians I didn't stay. The Russians I only came to them and I asked them for help. I asked them for help to do this thing with this Scharfuehrer, which they agreed. So I was with them altogether about 2 weeks. Til we prepared those things. And then later after, they wanted me to stay with them. But I figured the war is closing and closing and I had enough and I wanted to be liberated. Then I said to myself 1 will join the army. I don't want to be in the woods anymore. But the main thing, the longest time I was with the Jewish group, but unfortunately, there was very, very few left of us.  Okay. This was after we were shot by...when I was shot by the Agustins by the two brothers what I killed them. And I went to the AK. But my brother, as we run away from them, it was a very high snow. We stopped on the way by a friendly peasant and he gave us some old clothing and also he gave me a pair of shoes which fitted me. But for my brother he didn't have shoes because they didn't fit my brother...the too large foot. So we had to run away. And we went through a meadow which was low and it was covered with snow and underneath it was water, but was it covered with a very thin layer of ice. And as we walked, he broke the ice and the ice was so sharp that it cut his feet and it cut off the skin. He didn't feel it because it was very cold. When we came to our group, we saw that his feet are without skin. Naturally, we washed. We couldn't go to a doctor. We washed, and we put in some bandages. And he had to put some place to recuperate. So we brought him back to the same village where this shooting went on, but to a peasant. His name was Avisha...that he used to work for my father. He used to bring merchandise to my father. And we trusted him. And I didn't want to show that I am there. Because even my brother would be there, they would be afraid to do something to him I should remain as a witness. So my brother...] left him on the roof [attic?] in the stable and when he came to milk the cows he told them he's there. And he used to bring him every day about 5, 6 o'clock a quart of soup. And this was his food that he ate, that he brought him. Every evening he brought him a hot quart of soup. One day I came over there. And he noticed me. And I was afraid that he should see me there. Even I trusted him, but I figured those two boys were his friends and they belonged to the same group. When he noticed me, the same day, he didn't bring us food. And I told him, \\\"I am here, but I want to tell you one thing.\\u201d I asked him, what's going on in this village?\\\" He said, \\\"Nothing, Nothing.\\u201d And I didn't believe him because it was not nothing. I killed two of the best boys in this village.  04  Yes.  After the liberation, the same week, I joined the Polish Army.  I went and I joined. I didn't have to go, but I joined and I wanted to be a part of the Polish Armny, and I volunteered to join the air force. Because I wanted they should teach me and I should be a pilot and maybe I will be able to bomb Germany. And the school for officers for the air force was in Kuibichov. This was in Siberia in Russia. So when I waited for a transported, then I met a young Polish officer. She was a beautiful, nice girl in that uniform. She went through us, and we waited for the transport for the train to come. And we started to talk. And she said, \\\"What're you doing here?\\\" And I told this. She said, \\\"Well, you're going to be a pilot. It takes 2 years.\\u201d The war wouldn't last 2 years anymore. So why don't you come with me and you join our unit. We have a special unit, and if you want to take revenge, you will take plenty of revenge.\\u201d And I said, \\\"How can I do it. I have already the orders to go.\\u201d She said, \\\"Don't worry.\\u201d And she took me to her colonel and she showed him the orders. He took the orders and he ripped them up and he said, \\\"From now on, you will be with us.\\u201d And I joined them, and this is how I joined, this is how I met my wife. Because after six months, when we had to liberate Krakow, so I was already a big shot in this time and I came to Krakow and then when I find out about my wife and I came to have her killed. And this is a different story and this my wife probably will tell the story. Because Krakow had to be destroyed completely. And my wife was the secretary of the company who made the barricades and before we entered Krakow, we had to find somebody to get the plans to dismantle those barricades and through channels and channels we find out that it's her and three were sent out to get those plans. And I was one of the three. This was one day before Krakow was liberated. So I entered Krakow January the 18th 1945 and officially Krakow was liberated January the 19th. And my wife will tell you the rest story. I thought she's German. I hated her. She was beautiful. I saw my five sisters in here and we made up that after we get the plans, we'd kill her. And then she looked at me. When I came in, I started to interrogate her. She thought I am the biggest anti-Semitic Pole. She said, \\\"You're a snob,\\\" but later she told me, \\\"You're a snub nose and you're slavic, slavic face features.\\u201d But anyway I find out that she's Jewish. She find out I am Jewish. She was very happy. And this was our meeting. And we had to still go through in the war... January, February, March, April, May...This was still war. And then later in November, we got married.  We came to the United States January 1947. After I was transferred I escaped. I was in the German zone in Germany about 6 months, and then we came to the United States. We wanted to go to Palestine in this time, but it was impossible. So we came to the United States with the thought of going from here to Palestine. And this is other story. This is the other chapter and another book. But we are here, and we are very happy to be in America. America did for me more than I expected. I never dreamed that American can do this for me what actually I achieved. And now we had a daughter. We are very happy. My daughter has three little boys. And this is the most important thing is to show that Hitler didn't  completely succeed. He wanted to erase every European Jew in the Jewish race, and we are a continuation. Now one I want to tell you. After the war, we contemplated...we didn't know what to do. I was already a Pole. I had established position. My wife was Polish, an established position. And we didn't know. She started to study medicine in Poland after the war. So we didn't know what should we do. Should we become Jews and run away or should we stay and be Poles and maybe to save our future generations the heartache and the problems that we had. And we started to think about it. What should we do? And we decided no. Because we cannot do it. For two reasons. My wife couldn't do it because she had her family and her grandmother, uncles and her sister in Palestine. I couldn't do it because, it so happens we spoke yesterday about Kohanim. I am from the line of Kohanim. Now we know by Jews are very strict to follow male after male, and our lineage goes back til Aaron the high priest, the brother of Moses. And I said, \\\"Who am I to cut this chain. My father was killed because he was a Jew. Maybe his forefathers were killed because they were Jews. I have no right to come to me...it reached me after 2...after three and and a half thousand years. Because since Aaron is between three and and half thousand years and four thousand. Who am I that I should cut this line? So I said, \\\"For this reason, we have to remain Jews, and we shouldn't be the one to say this is it.\\u201d If we would do it, it means that Hitler succeeded. We will resign from being Jews. For this reason, we had to continue.\\\"  Okay. You're welcome.\",\n          \" Lore Baer.  I was born in Amsterdam, Holland, August 26, 1938. And, uh, my parents had come to Amsterdam from Germany. Uh, my mother was born in Erfurt which is the eastern sector of Germany and my father was born in Frankfurt-am-Main. And, uh, in 1933, my, my parents came to Holland to avoid, uh, and evade Hitler. Uh, it was no no longer safe for Jewish people to be in, in Germany at that time and they thought that they would be safer in in Holland. Uh, a friend of my father's had started a butcher shop in Amsterdam, uh, on a street called the Van Baerlestraat which is a main street right across from the Concertgebouw. It's still...it, it's still a big street in in Amsterdam today and, uh, he opened up a butcher shop and although my father didn't have any background in, in, in that business at all, he felt that that was the only way he could really leave Germany and have an income so he, uh, went into a partnership with this friend of his and, uh, was in Amsterdam for several years before my mother joined him there. My mother and, uh, my grandfather, uh, came to Amsterdam and, uh, joined my father and I was born, as I said, in 1938, and at that time things seemed to be going fairly smoothly. We didn't have a tremendous amount of problems. I grew up pretty much like any young, uh, kid would in, you know, in Holland. I learned how to speak the language. Although my parents were German, they also learned to speak the language, which probably wasn't that difficult for them. They were still pretty young and, uh, I went to nursery school and my mother helped my father in the store because, uh, it was growing and so she and, uh, and he and ran the store and my grandfather took care of me, and he was pretty much the one who was in charge of, uh, my growing up and he and I went walking together and I have very fond memories of my, as I called him my opa\\u2019 and, uh, he was my mother's father and the only grandparent that I ever knew. Uh, my other grandparents had died before I was born and, uh, he was just very dear to me and very special and, but he became ill. He was quite a bit older, uh, than my grandmother had been, although she died when my mother was sixteen and, uh, my grandfather was not too well and, but he lived with us in an apartment in, uh, in Amsterdam. Uh, I'm not exactly sure of the, the street although my mother has said that it's the street called Wauwermanstraat, uh, which does exist today as well. Uh, I don't recall a great deal about my very early childhood except that my grandfather was very, very dear to me and that I had a little playmate called Harold who, uh, was the son of, uh, my father's partner. Unfortunately he died when, before my childhood friend Harold, uh, was born, so he never knew his father and so we were quite a large extended family. Uh,  \\\" Grandpa.  this young boy Harold, his mother Erna, and my mother, my father, my grandfather and I and we, we were very close and, uh, again I don't remember a great deal of what was happening, uh,  in Amsterdam at the time except I knew that the climate, what the climate was like and there was a tremendous amount of tension and I saw that my parents worked very hard and were very serious and I just remembered that and I remember my mother being very nervous a lot and crying a lot and I remember my, uh, my grandfather, a tremendous amount of concern about my grandfather and I only found out really much later that, uh, the reason there was this concern was because the Germans were beginning to round up old people in Holland and they were beginning to round them up to take them to concentration camps. And when I was about, I guess it was four or five, somewhere in that area, uh, my grandfather was in fact, uh, taken away by the Gestapo and I remember that very well. I remember, I remember him being in a wheel chair and I remember standing next to him and I remember there was a knock on the door and and my mother was screaming and I don't know what she was screaming except something like they're coming, they're coming. Uh, so, you know, for opa...they're coming for opa...and I think up to, up till that time my father did what ever he could, uh, to, uh, either bribe the Germans and with, with salami and meat and because the butcher shop was a very desirable thing but I guess it, it reached the point where that could no longer be done and so these two uniformed men...that's all I remember...they were very tall...they knocked on the door and my grandfather was in a wheel chair and there was really nothing to be done. They just took him away and and I never saw him again. And they took him to Bergen-Belsen and and that was the last I ever saw of him, and shortly after that, uh, things just started turning very bad. I think that that was when they were rounding Jews. It was in 19, uh, 43 or maybe before that already. Uh, they were starting to round up Jews and deporting them and my father had, uh, made friends with this very nice couple. They were called Elsa and Sam Izaaks, uh, and they lived somewhere in near Amsterdam I think in a place called Zandvoort which is Am..a suburb and, uh, she was Gentile and he was Jewish and she worked for the...they both worked for the underground. They both tried to help place, uh, families with, with, uh, Dutch Gentile families. They tried to help Jewish families and, uh, and so my father asked if there was any way that they could, uh, try to find a place for them and it was told to me that it was not safe for, uh, for us to be together, so, uh, we had to be separated and my mother and father had to leave me and find...and the underground had to find a place for me and they had to find a place for them as well.  And I guess I really...I don't really remember how I felt, but I must have felt or what I think now, what I think about and how it must have felt to, you know, to leave your child must have been pretty unbearable for my parents and it was probably very difficult for me too, but again I don't remember that very, very well. Uh, again it was told to me that I had been placed by this couple with, uh, one other or maybe two other families in, uh, Gentile families   in Holland, but that I didn't like them and I didn't want to stay with them and I cried a lot and I was very unhappy so they, uh, they found this wonderful family for me who I lived with for two years and they were the Schouten family and they lived in, uh, Oosterlokker which is about forty miles outside of Amsterdam and they had a farm and it was Ma and Pa Schouten,\\u201d and they were I guess in their fifties. Uh, and they had five children. They had two daughters...uh, Triene [Catheriena] and Cornelia, and three sons and that was Jan [Johannes], uh, Kees [Cornelius] and Cor [Cornelis], and they were all in their twenties but the one that I was the most attached to was Cornelia. She was twenty-five at the time that I was five and placed with her and she was just very special. She sort of took me under her wing, uh, and when I cried for my mother and father, she just... she was just with me. She Just comforted me and at night when I cried she would sleep with me and she would hold my hand and she would tell me stories and, uh, they were very religious Catholic people and, uh, they went to church regularly and of course before I left, my mother had told me that my name would not be the same. I would be living with other people, not with them, and I should never divulge my real name because it would not be safe and I should not divulge that I was Jewish and I should just remember that that they loved me very much and that hopefully they would see me again and, uh, they were, uh, and I, I just remember that this family was very special and warm and and good and I just really loved them and, uh, I liked being there and they had, uh, because they had such a large family they had a lot of children in the neighborhood for me to play with and from what Cornelia tells me now, while I don't remember it, I didn't cry very much after the first week and I didn't seem to miss my parents very much after that and I sort of just fit in and played with the children in the neighborhood and one of the things I thought about was how I fit in with them, because I had always pictured that I would...this is in going back and thinking what it might have been like then ..and I had always pictured that all Dutch people had blonde hair so I had fantasized that I had had my hair dyed blonde and I asked Cornelia on this trip whether I in fact had my hair dyed blonde and she said no, it wasn't necessary because her father, uh, had dark hair. In fact he was called, uh, the black Schouten because there were others with that name but they all had blonde hair and he was, uh, and he had dark hair so it's not as though I didn't fit in, uh, in terms of, you know, hair coloring. I did.  And there were a number of things that I probably fantasized in terms of, uh, coming to terms myself with what happened at the time and how I might have been protected by these people. Uh, from I, I seem to have remembered clearly that by because I was Catholic now and living with this family that I had a rosary and that I, I prayed with this rosary every day and Cornelia doesn't remember that at all, so I would think that if she doesn't remember it, it probably never happened but this is probably how I sort of resolved my being Catholic and also, uh, I thought that I was brought up by the nuns in the Catholic school, and again I don't think that that...Cornelia doesn't seem to think that there were any nuns in the school that I went to. Uh, I was, uh, a very stubborn child and I...it was told to me that I was, when I went  > Martha Schouten-Stam and Theodorus Schouten.  to school, uh, I was really, uh, I was not very...uh, what's the word I'm looking for...empathic with people who weren't religious Catholics and that if I saw people that weren't, or kids that weren't that weren't, uh, saying their prayers or doing their homework I would point them out as not being good Catholics like I was. Uh, and when I came to the Shoutens, my name as I said could not be Lore Baer. It was Lora Kruk and, uh, I hated that name and because it meant that I wasn't anything. I wasn't Baer and I wasn't Schouten, so I really, uh, begged them to have me, name me Schouten so after a lot of cajoling, I guess, they agreed that I could call myself Lore Schouten.  Now, uh, the Schouten family, uh, Ma and Pa were also very stubborn, uh, Dutch people. They, they lived in a neighborhood that seemed to be very sympathetic to, to people who were, uh, discriminated against in any way, not necessarily Jews, and I was under the impression that the two other people who they harbored...there were two other people living with me, uh, underground on the farm...I was under the impression that they were Jewish but it turns out that neither of them were Jewish. They were, uh, young men who, who were to be conscripted into the German army and they did not want to, uh, join the army because they didn't want to have anything to do with the Germans, so they were also fleeing and they were also in hiding and, uh, they did not...and they were sympathetic to this as well as the other neighbors in the area were sympathetic to the same, uh, to Jews as well as to Protestants as well as to conscientious objectors or people who just didn't sympathize with the Germans, which there many of and it seems to me that my, my memories of this family and my life there were really, uh, very good memories. I don't remember a great deal of, uh, bombing of that area. I don't remember a great deal of, uh, hardship. In fact that particular area was very fortunate because it was a farm area and everybody, uh, in the area was either a dairy farmer or a vegetable farmer and the Schouten family had a dairy farm. In fact, Cornelia tells me that her father was supposed to deliver a certain quantity of, uh, milk to the German army and he was greatly opposed to doing this and he refused. He, in fact, he felt that if he was going to produce milk he wanted to give it to the Dutch people and he was called, uh, in to, uh, by the Germans to come to Amsterdam. Again, this was told just to me this week, which I didn't know about...uh, to explain his actions and it, it seems that, uh, in order for the Germans to, uh, to ma...to scare him, he was supposed to read when he came to Amsterdam a list of, uh, the names of all the people who had been killed by the Germans for doing the same thing, and he knew that if he was to do this and he claimed that he couldn't read any German so...I mean that he couldn't read ...and that, so he didn't have to do that but that's an indication of how stubborn this man was and how...but also how he risked his, you know, his life and his ideals not only for the Jewish people but just for humanity and, you know, just for doing the right thing. He felt so strongly that this was the wrong thing that, you know, his actions in every way indicated that you must do what is right and listening to what the Germans tell you to do is not the right thing    and, uh, he, uh, he obviously...his children obviously felt very much this way too. Uh, because and his grandchildren, because last year when I went back to, to, uh, to the farm with some friends of mine, my friend asked one of the grandsons, uh, how...what he would have done in a similar situation and his grandson said, is there any choice? How could I act differently? And it, it's to me incredible that a young person today who is now twenty years old would say that when obviously there were many choices and there are many people who did other things and not what this family did. So my memories, uh, are that I that I led a fairly normal childhood there and and I, uh, helped on the farm. I didn't have any toys really because on the farm you, you know, you play outdoors and I played outdoors a lot. I went bicycling a lot and, uh, and it was my impression that when the Gestapo came around, uh, I hid with the two other undergrounders and there was a trap door in a closet that led to a hayloft. Now the way the, the house is constructed, the farmhouse is a house with the actual barn and hayloft attached to it. It's all one building, so that the trap door of the closet that you would, you know, it was the whole, basically the floor boards of the closet lifted up and led to a staircase which led under the ground and up to a little room in the hayloft and the little room was covered over with hay and there was a window in this room which, when you push away the hay, you could see out but of course you didn't push away the hay because you didn't want anybody to see you, so this was like a room within the hayloft that you got to, and this was the secret hiding place where we would remain, uh, when the Germans came. Cornelia tells me that they came, when they did come, very often instead of hiding in the hayloft she would, uh, bicycle with me to another neighborhood. We would just...she would say to me let's just go for a bicycle ride and she would bike down the road with me to another area, uh, so that I wouldn't be so scared because she, I gather, was felt that I would be very frightened by having to hide, so she thought it would be better if, if it was a more normal kind of a situation where we would just go bicycling together and she would try to distract me. And I don't recall that,  but I do recall spending a lot of time with her and I remember a lot of the things that I really had forgotten came back to me last year when I went back to, to the farmhouse, which I didn't recognize at first because they had changed the front of it, but as I bicycled away from the house and I looked towards...looked over my shoulder, I saw the farm the way I had remembered it and the part that had not been changed and then the, you know, just the visuals came back to me and then I went back into the farm. Her brother lives in...Cornelia's brother still lives on the farm now and it's pretty much intact the way it was when I was there, except the room that I lived in is now, uh, a stall for animals and, uh, but other than that nothing much has changed, and I've taken some, some photographs. I took some photographs last year, uh, of that and the living room and the dining room and the kitchen are pretty much the way it was when I was there and it was interesting because when we sat down and had lunch together, the thing that I remember was the soup and the way they made little meatballs and the smell of the soup and the way it was served and the prayer that they said before the meal are all things that I remember. It wasn't, uh...it was all the good things that I remembered, and still remember, you know, just the warmth... churning butter with   Cornelia in the back and learning how to make cheese and learning how to bake, because a lot of that was done and Cornelia did a lot of that with me. Uh, that's what I remember. I remember just the warmth, uh, and that's, you know, to me the important part of things. Uh, I don't remember, uh, the Gestapo coming except for one time and I seem to recall, although Cornelia doesn't remember but her nephew Dick does have some memories of this, that there was also a manhole cover in the garden in the...or not the garden but the pasture in back of the house, uh, where we would also go down into it was like a sewer-like hole that would lead to, uh, into a a dark area. Now I may be confusing that with, uh, with the stairs and the closet that we walked into. I don't know, because she doesn't re... recall it. Uh, and my recollection was that we were staying down in that area for about a week, but she said it was more like an hour if at all, so I guess, you know, time plays funny tricks on you.  Uh, the things that I remember too were the many people, uh, uh, that came to the house always. There was always a great deal of activity at the house. Uh, the many relatives, the aunts and uncles and cousins and brothers and sisters and family and the busy work place... you know, the milking of the cows and, uh, and I remember making wreaths out of buttercups for my hair, that Cornelia taught me how to make too. And, uh, very often she would make me a little wreath that I would put around my hair and although I've tried to do the same with my own children, I've forgotten how to do it. And again when I went back to Holland last year and I went biking through the fields, through the, through the countryside, through the Dutch countryside, it was really the memory that I have of the stillness and the sort of the flatness and the beauty of those buttercups that I remember and sort of the cows grazing and just that sort of peaceful time and, uh, sometimes now that I think back I remember the green uniforms...the khaki colored uniforms of the Gestapo, but I think it must have been difficult for the Gestapo in that area because the neighbors were very, very close with each other and told each other when they were coming, when someone from the Gestapo was coming by.  And as I said earlier, I was fortunate to be in that particular region because when there was a famine in Amsterdam, I think it was in '44, people came for vegetables and potatoes and milk because there was no food to be had in Amsterdam. The only place where you could get food was in the farm country. What I remember is--I don't remember a tremendous amount of hardships or famine, I don't remember doing without. I remember things were good. When I think back how, what it must have been for my parents, its very different. Living with another family, and they moved around a great deal before they found a family that took them in where they felt comfortable. They were with people for about, at least four or five different families, and many of the families took in a lot of borders and a lot of them took in Jews and got paid for it. It was very dangerous for a lot of people because they, for people like my parents, so when they felt uncomfortable in a house, when they felt there were people who might talk, and who might divulge that they were Jews, they had to move   on, and they were very fortunate also the last year and a half before the war ended to live with a family, as it turned out, only ten miles from where I was living but unbeknownst to me and unbeknownst to them because it wasn't safe for them to know where I was because if they knew they would want to find me, and if I knew I would want to probably find them as well. So that was never spoken about and Cornelia tells me that her family did not know where my parents were, didn't know my real name, didn't know where I came from. But after the war the family that my parents were with knew where I was living. They had know that; somehow they had found out. But my family lived in very tight quarters. They lived with a couple who had one daughter and in a town not far from Oosterblokker called Berkhout. I went, I went back there last year and unfortunately the house is not standing the way it was. It's now a garage. It was a very small, humble home and these people shared whatever food they had; they were not farmers, with my mother and father. You know they did the same thing that the Schouten family did, but my mother and father did not, were not able to leave the house and go bicycle riding and play outdoors. They had to stay in hiding in their house all those years. And it wasn't safe because no one in that neighborhood could really know about them. I think maybe one other couple knew about them, but that was it.  So when the war did end and my mother and father came for me, I really didn't want to go back with them. Probably it was a combination of being worried that they would leave me again, maybe it was that I had a new family name, I had friends, I was in school, I was comfortable, and it was very difficult for me. I think it was more difficult for me after the war than it was during the war. I just, I just felt very much alone when I left because I didn't have any friends and my mother and father really didn't know any people anymore in Amsterdam. They had no family. My grandfather, we never heard from again. And, so after, when my parents did come for me, I really didn't want to go with them at all. I claimed that I didn't recognize my father. I had remembered him as very, very tall, and he wasn't all that tall and it was a very difficult thing for my mother and father whose only hope and only wish was to be reunited with me. For me not to want to go with them must have been a really horrible thing. I mean, I think back to what would happen in my situation, how it would feel. I mean it must have been awful. But I was just a kid, I was seven years old and I was interested in playing and, you know, in my friends. So that's all I could think about.  So we went, after the war, my father was able to get his store back, his butcher shop, which had been taken away by the Germans in 1943, when all Jews had to give up any of their property and any of their belongings and their apartments and whatever they had that belonged to them, they had to give up. But after the war he was able to reclaim his butcher shop, which he did, and he worked there for another two years, waiting to get a visa to come to America. And the only way we could get that really was through my father's brother who was living in America and he helped us with the formalities of getting to the United States. And I went back to school in Amsterdam and had a very difficult time in Amsterdam, in the   city and the school, and missed the farm a great deal. I remember I was very sad and I was very nervous at night. I remember not sleeping well at all because I was so scared that my parents would leave me again or that the Germans would come and I guess I just couldn't really understand the concept of the war and the end of the war, and that it was all over and now I would be with my parents again forever, and I really missed my playmates. I remember that very well and, uh, we lived in an apartment that...it's sort of vague to me, but it was an apartment that I think while our...while we couldn't get our our original apartment back we lived in this, uh, apartment that one of the Germans had lived in during the war who was quite wealthy, and I remember the apartment as being quite luxurious and the kind of a place where you couldn't touch anything and and so different from the farm where, you know, everything was so comfortable and I could just run around and here I felt I had to be this proper lady and everything had to be kept perfectly because the apartment didn't belong to us and the furnishings didn't belong to us and nothing really belonged to us and, uh, I just felt uncomfortable, and, uh, I don't remember anything about school. I remember that there was a young boy who I was friendly with who lived in this apartment...uh, it was a brownstone on the Amsteldijk in, in Amsterdam. And I remember befriending him and I remember being close with him and I remember again then having to come to America and being uprooted from from him as well, and I don't remember seeing my family, the farm family, at all after that.  Uh, and I remember when I came to America living in the Bronx with another family because we didn't have any money and they took us in for about a year and I started to learn English and they were very good to us. They had three daughters and one of them took me under her wing and taught me English and, uh, we lived with them in their house for about a year and again, I felt, you know, this sort of constant uprooting and this not knowing where I was really going to be. Will I ever be permanently in any one place and always the fear, you know, of, of leaving but I really had...I I was eighteen before I went back to Holland again to see the Schoutens and it was very difficult for me. Uh, I was very, very nervous because I didn't speak Dutch anymore. I never kept it up because my parents didn't speak Dutch at home. They spoke only German because their friends were were friends that they had from Germany that came over to America before the war and they had a circle of German friends and they wanted to forget the war. They wanted to forget the time and so for them, uh, I mean Dutch just wasn't a language that was spoken. My mother wanted me to become Americanized as quickly as possible. She wanted me to speak English. I didn't want to speak German because I hated the language. I hated the Germans. I hated everything that represented that time. So I didn't, uh, speak German and I didn't speak Dutch and when I went back to Holland when I was eighteen, uh, I wanted to I wanted to, uh, you know, thank these people for the wonderful thing they had done for me and how they had saved my life but I was kind of tongue-tied, you know. I just didn't have the words and I had heard that the Dutch people really hated, uh, if they hated the Germans and they hated people who spoke German and while I didn't speak German I I understood German perfectly and when I spoke whatever Dutch I knew, I kept mixing my Dutch and German, and I was really afraid that I   was going to offend them that by speaking, you know, Dutch with a, with German mixed in and it really took me all these years to realize that they wouldn't care what I spoke. They really had no, you know, uh, I mean it didn't really matter. I think it took me up till last year to realize that...that I could have spoken to them in gibberish...it would have been all right, uh, you know, because whatever connection I felt, they must have felt too. So I feel very...I feel very sad that I hadn't kept up a connection with this family all these years. I really, uh, only started thinking about Holland and what I went through again when I was fifty last year, and that's when I felt that I had to go back and make a connection again, even though the parents that, uh, kept me were no longer alive, uh, and the only real connection that I felt that I had there was Cornelia and, uh, again the problem of the language, but luckily there were many people in Holland that spoke Dut...uh, English that were able to interpret for me so when I went back to see Cornelia last year, it was a very short visit  because again I felt like it would be very uncomfortable not being able to speak the language, uh, but it, you know, gave me time from last year to this year to think about what these people had done and to what it means, uh, not only to me but I think to to my children, to my family, to my friends...uh, that they have risked their lives at a time when it was very dangerous to go against what was told to them to do which was that all the Jews were being rounded up and and they must, you know, follow the dictum of the government of Germany which had occupied Holland at that time, and I really feel that for people to do what they did without any, uh, I mean to them what they did was what they feel every human being should do. They really feel that it was nothing. They feel like what they did was only the right thing, that it's not something unusual for them and when I think about how, when I think back now what I would have done, I don't think I would have done the same thing. I think that if I had a family and if there was a threat that my family might be killed or if my family would, uh, be hurt or that I might be, I don't think I could have made that decision and now I will think differently because I lived through that, but I, I hope that people don't have to live through that to make the decision to help another human being, to save another human being, and, uh, so that's why I think it's so important, you know, people like this, uh, talk about their experiences so that other young people and our children and, uh, my friends\\u2019 children and future generations will think about what it is to do the right thing and what it is to save human life and what it is to risk your own life, and that's I guess all I can say.\",\n          \" Tam Max Kar! Liebmann.  I was born in Mannheim, Germany, on September 3, 1921.  My father was \\u2014 had a -- was in his own business. He and his brother had a textile representation business. They represented a -- what is called here, a converter of textile goods. They had one of the largest -- or the largest European weaver of textile goods and before \\u201933 -- they also had some Czech clothes -- cloth firms, and eventually, after 1933, and a few other companies which I can't remember. And after 1933, in particularly, after 1934, when my father's partner which was his brother had a stroke and could no longer work, my father remained with two companies which stayed with him until they could no longer employ him, due to Nazi legislation.  I was in Mannheim 'til I was deported in 1940.  The first 10 years were very -- basically very uneventful. I was told I grew in the midst of the  inflation and my parents were middle or upper-middle class and my childhood was very uneventful.  I went first in 1928, I started public school. In Germany, you go to public school for four years and then you switch to high school. In 19 -- when I was about 8, in 1930. I started with cello lessons and in 1932, I switched from public school to what was called Realgymnasium!. The Realgymnasium is something which I don't think we have here. You start -- in your first year, you start with Latin, then in the third year, you get, in addition to Latin, you get French and in the fourth year, in addition to Latin and French, we got English.  And I went to school until I decided at the end of December 1937 that it makes no more sense for me to continue school. When I quit school, I was sent in the what was called Obertertia\\u2019. I would have had three more years to go to make -- to graduate, which was called in Germany abitur\\u2019. Obviously, everything changed with the advent of Hitler and I have memories that there were the emergency police running around the city in their car -- in their automobiles because they were always demonstrations and counter-demonstrations. We had a balcony where I could watch this very clearly. We were living on a fairly important thoroughfare. School became more difficult with the advent of Hitler. I think it was in the second or third grade of high school -- I was about 11 or 12 when the taunting started. And it was harmless -- it wasn't badly meant, but it was grinding, because it went on and it went on and it went on. So, in the school I went to, there was a custom that each -- each class every other year goes together into a youth hostel for three days to play football -- to play soccer, and generally to have a good time. And I picked this particular time to have a fight with one of the guys who were taunting me and I beat him up. I picked one I could handle. And from that moment on, there was peace, not only for me, but also for my other three Jewish classmates. We were four Jews in my class. I had basically no problem with the exception of one altercation I had with a -- with my German professor. He was a member of the party, if I remember correctly. He -- one day we had to write a paper about how we could contribute to the Four Year Plan. That was an economic plan which Goring\\\" was supervising. And when I got the paper back, I got a bad mark with a note that I must have copied this out of a newspaper or a magazine. So I didn't let this sit. Challenged him to show me where I copied it from. Unbeknownst to me, I used American style, \\u201cyou're innocent until proven guilty.\\u201d And eventually he had to change the mark. He did.  At the end of December of 1937 we were only two Jewish boys left in my class and very few other Jews in the whole school, and I decided it made no sense to stay in school . I -- I knew I would never go to a university in Germany. It became more and more difficult, so I told my parents, \\\"Enough is enough. I want out.\\\" And I started -- then we compromised and in the  ' Liberal arts high school (German)  \\u00b0 The sixth grade level in German Gymnasiums (German)  3 High school graduation examination (German)  \\u201cHermann Goring beginning of 19-- immediately at the first few days of 1938, I went into a private, commercial language school where I had French and I had English. I learned German, steno\\u2019, just to keep me busy. After all, in 1930 -- at the beginning of \\u201838, I was just 17 years old -- not -- no -- 16 years old. And I went to school there until the famous Crystal Night\\u00ae of 1938 which was the end of school and basically for all German-Jewish children.  Yeah.  We were not observant Jews in the -- in the sense that there was a kosher household or any such thing. My father belonged to a Gesangsverien\\u2019, which is a singing organization which is very customary in, in Germany. This one happened to be the Jewish one. And my father was a member of that Board of Directors since almost immediately after World War I. Incidentally, my father was a soldier in World War I and was a veteran of front service, which permitted me actually to stay -- to stay in high school as long as did, because I believe in 1936 or 1935 already, the children of non-veterans were legislated out of public schools. So, no we -- I mean we never -- my father also was a member of the legislative body of the Jewish community of Mannheim so there was never a question of where we belonged or where we were, but we did not per se be practicing Jews that we went regularly to temple. I mean I was Bar Mitzvah, of course, my father would make an appearance as a member of the legislative counsel at least once a year in the temple on, on Rosh Hashanah or Yom Kippur. I went a few \\u2014 I went a number of times on Saturday morning more for social reasons than any other reasons -- we would meet with our friends. And, of course, we had every Friday night, there were -- a different meal with the German version of challah which is called Berches*. And so we were, of course -- obviously it was not a matter of denying that we were Jews. We were Jews, but there was no practice -- practicing Judaism. We would not light a home candles for Hanukkah or would have a Seder, not withstanding the fact that for -- for these days, I always went to my uncle and my aunt, my -- the sister of my mother had no children of her own and until they immigrated in 1930 -- early in \\u201834 to Palestine, I was there on all these holidays like Pesach, etceteras, etceteras.   5 stenography  \\u00b0 Kristallnacht  7 glee club (German)  * German-Jewish braided holiday bread.  Yeah. No, that is okay. Since my father was very active in -- in this what originally started out for 80 or 90 years as a singing organization, was converted in 1933 or 1934, into what was referred to as a Jewish cultural organization. And since we were excluded from everything which had to do with culture, we had our own. In addition to the cause which was a mixed choir, there was an orchestra added, and by the time I was 14 or 15, I was in the orchestra and we did all kinds of opera, opera performances, oratorios. And all this, of course, stopped with the event in of -- at Crystal Night. Incidentally my father at the time of Crystal Night was in Greece. His -- one of his companies where he was always the number one salesman, suggested to him since they couldn't employ him anymore in Germany, if he wouldn\\u2019t want to try to build an existence in Greece. We'll come back to this a little later. Let's do it chron--chronologically.  No. No. No. I didn't mean the conversion as a -- in a religious sense.  I meant it, it used to be a it used to be simply an organization where an orchestra was -- the local orchestra was hired and they would sing concerts. Now we added on a an orchestra and it became a self-sustaining, Jewish cultural organization, where culture was continued parallel to whatever we were able to do with restrictions obviously. We were not permitted to do German composers. We had to restrict ourselves to either foreign composers or Jewish composers so we could not perform after 1934, I think, or \\u00b035 -- Bach was out. But we did do Orpheus and Eurydice, by Gluck\\u2019. We were permitted to do an Offenbach'\\u00ae opera -- operetta. We did Judas, Judas Maccabaeus, by Handel\\\"! and things like this.  Crystal Night, I went to school. This is a commercial school where I went like on every day, and it seems to be I walked on that day. Why I walked and didn't use a bicycle, I cannot remember. But I walked. And I did not really see much of mobs because I was in school at eight o'clock. I saw something which struck me funny. I didn't give it a second thought. I  \\u00b0 Christoph Willibald Gluck  wy acques (nee Jacob) Offenbach  u George Frideric Handel went to school and around nine or nine-thirty, the telephone I was called by the directress and was told, \\\"Your mother has called. You should leave school immediately, and you should go to Heidelberg and you should wait in Heidelberg for your cousin who will come separately and you will spend the day in Heidelberg. When I called home to find out what was going on, I was told, \\\"Don't ask so many stupid questions. Just go to Heidelberg and call me tonight.\\\" So Heidelberg being only 10 miles from Mannheim, I walked myself over from the school to the. . railway station which was only a 10 minute walk.  And on the way I started to realize what was going on in the city. I saw furniture being thrown out of windows and people being arrested, but since I didn't look Jewish in their sense, nobody bothered me. So I went to the railroad station, bought a ticket to Heidelberg, and 15 minutes later was in Heidelberg where I met my cousin and we spent the day in the famous Heidelberg woods, walking and there seems to be a -- a faint memory that we were supposed to touch base with a -- I don't know if it was a far relative of my grandmother or just friends. In any case they were of Czech nationality and we were supposed to touch base there to see what was going on and I arranged -- we agreed with my cousin that this would take place around -- after four o\\u2019clock in the afternoon. So we walked in the woods, and my cousin got very nervous and wanted to come down much earlier. However, I said, \\\"No. We, we said -- we agreed it was four o\\u2019clock. We are not going to change the date.\\u201d Which was very fortunate because by the time I -- we got there or shortly after four o'clock, the man had been arrested. If we would have gotten there earlier, we would have probably been arrested to. So we continued walking around in Heidelberg and when I called my mother at seven o\\u2019clock, she said she thinks the worst is over.  We should come home. Now let me add there that in the beginning of 1938, since nobody knew how long we would have to stay in Germany or would be in Germany, my father was gone and there was no income coming we had given up our own apartment and had moved in with my grandmother. My grandmother happened to be a French citizen which is a story in itself which came about shortly after the war. She wanted to go to Mannheim's twin city, Ludwigshafen.  After World War I. And when she came -- she was on the trolley car and when she came to the rail to the bridge across the Rhine to Lugwigshafen, the French had blocked passage for the day. They did this on occasion. And so my Grandmother descended from the trolley car and was trying to force her way across the bridge. She called the watch commander and explained to him that she is born before the Franco-Prussian War in 1970\\u2019 in the Alsace and  \\u201d The interviewee later corrects this date to 1870. therefore, by rights, she is French. And the man happened to be a lawyer and explained to her that in order to become a French citizen again, she would simply have to apply for what was called reinstatement of some kind -- I forgot the French word right now -- which she did . Therefore my Grandmother in 1920 or \\u201821 -- my mother always told the stories at -- during World War I, there were no political discussion in her house because my grandmother, not withstanding the fact that her future son-in-law was a German soldier and her husband was a German -- was always a French patriot. So my Grandmother then applied for reinstatement and became a French citizen. So in 1938, on Crystal Night day, which was November 10th, when the destruction took place, my mother called the French consulate when the sab started to smash in the back loft where my grandmother had commercial space rented out to a Jewish store who sold glass -- glass fixtures, electrical glass fixtures. And this was smashed to millions of bits and when my mother called -- my mother called the French Consulate because after all the apartment was in the name of my grandmother -- was a large apartment -- in order to protect the apartment from destruction. And within five or 10 minutes an SA man in uniform came, stopped the carnage in the back loft and was posted there all day long in order to protect my grandfather's apartment who was after all a French citizen. So I came home in, in the evening. Without a doubt the apartment was destroyed, but I do remember that one or two days after the 10th of November, I went to Ludwigshafen to help a former member of the orchestra straighten out her apartment which was in, in pitiful shape.  After Crystal Night 1938, I spent 1939 basically doing nothing. There was nothing I could do. I was reading a book a day and then war broke out. Now I think we should come back to my father. In March of 1938, my father went to Greece, and after a few months was able to start selling his company's goods again which did not sit too well with the German competition. And when they figured out in 1939 who was behind their loss of business which went to another firm, they managed to get my father expelled from Greece. My father went, I think in May, from Greece to Italy. In fact, my mother visited him in August of 1939 in Italy. She had a passport. We all had passports. And at that time was so convinced that nobody would be insane enough to start another war -- this was in August of 1939 -- that she came back home and instead of calling me who also had a passport to join her in Italy, so the family would have been reunited. So my mother came home second my father illegally went from Ventimiglia to Nice, across country on a boat -- on a little boat around the border and, of course, did all the things other people did who came in illegally. He was in jail for a few weeks, and then he lived precariously in the Nice until he was accidentally until he ran into a German patrol accidentally in, in 1944, and was deported. My mother came back home and on first of September 1939, World War Two broke out. The first thing which happened was that we were called to a Wehrmacht\\\" office where we were mustered out of the army for being Jewish. In other words, we could not serve. We were not -- it was, it was not dignified for Jews to serve in the German, army.  8 Sturmabteilung [storm troopers] (German)  \\u20184 Armed forces (German)  No. We had not been admitted to the German army, but we were mobilized like everybody else and had to present ourself in a separate little office and these soldiers were very nice about it and -- but of course, we, we were not mobilized. Then in -- that was in the middle of September. Shortly after that, I was required to perform how would you call this, harvesting service in East Germany. That was east of Frank--Frankfurt on the Oder. It was very far away in those days, it was a trip overnight through Berlin and then to Frankfurt on the Oder, and I was in a small village. We were quartered in the hall where you normally would have weddings. There were they installed platforms where we could sleep on. There were about 30 or 40 young people of Jewish -- German Jews, and we helped farmers harvest the sugar beets and potatoes. I don't know how much we harvested, but I can assure you every time I hit a -- I made an effort to hit into every potato and every sugar beet I had to dig out. And what was traumatic about this was not that we had to do this, but in Germany, there's a law, on the -- was on the books, probably still on the books -- that when you move from one location to the other, you have to go to the local police precinct and notify them you are going from here to there, so that your records are maintained and, of course, my mother probably worried that if, when I would -- when I come back, there would be trouble. But when we were there six weeks and when I came back, there was no trouble. I just registered again I am back. That was the end of it. Then my mother was able to arrange that in on January the third, I think, or second, immediately after the first of the year in -- of 1940, I started to work at the Hilfsverein\\u2019\\u2019. The Hilfsverein was an organization set up by the National Representation of German Jews in Berlin to assist people with their immigration problems and since America was still out of the war at that time, there was -- Jews still could immigrate.  German Jews were still able to immigrate to the United States or to Cuba so we had a very busy office and I was working there as a volun--volunteer secretary until we were deported. And in order to be able to work there, I had to travel to Berlin to present myself to the chief of this organization. In the Jewish Reichsvertretung\\u2019\\u00ae, You know the German Jews had their own organization who represented the Jews with the vis a vis the government and I traveled at night from Mannheim to Berlin, presented myself in the morning to the chief -- was a man with a beard whose name I don't remember anymore -- and traveled back the same night from Berlin -- the next, next night from Berlin back to Mannheim which was not very pleasant because my mother decided I should travel second class. It would be more  'S Hilfsverein der Deutschen Juden [German Jews\\u2019 Aid Society](German)  \\u20186 Reichsvertretung der Juden in Deutschland [Reich Representation of Jews in  Germany ](German) comfortable since I would not sleep for two nights and all I had in the compartment were either officers of the army or SS\\\" officers who were traveling \\u2014 it wasn't very funny. But you know I did what my father always did when my father was traveling, as long as he was traveling and working until the end of 1937. He always had Nazi newspapers, so I did the same thing. I had Nazi newspapers and they left, no--nobody bothered me. So nothing much happened in 1940, until on October 21st around 10 o'clock the telephone ran in the office and the chief of my office was at the same time the representative of the Mannheim Jewish community with regard to the Gestapo. So at 10 o'clock around the telephone rang. The Gestapo was on the phone -- he should come down immediately, which he did. He had weekly contact with them. He probably had to report to them on -- on the state of immigration and how people you know people -- we were still able to get a lot of people out. And in fact my own cousin was able to leave through Russia, went to Japan, and managed to get into San Francisco before the outbreak of the war. So he was lucky. The head of this office came back and told us, \\\"We're going to close up now. We are going to be deported tomorrow to France.\\\" And he went upstairs to notify the president of the Mannheim Jewish community. And so eventually around noon, we closed up the community offices. We went home. When I came home, I said to my mother, \\\"We are going to pack now because we're going to be sent to France tomorrow.\\\"  And my mother was totally -- couldn't believe this. So I started to pull out suitcases, started to put stuff together which I wanted to take along and when she saw I was really dead serious about it, she finally -- half-heartedly believed that what I was saying was true, and then after dark, at night, a -- we had a man who worked for us, bringing up coal from the basement, when we lived in our own apartment. And he came at night surreptitiously, to tell us that he had heard from his friends at the police, that we would be deported tomorrow to France. And then she finally believed it. Unfortunately, why we couldn't -- we were not able to communicate with our friends because telephones were no longer an item for Jewish families after 1939. So we packed and indeed, the next morning the Gestapo rang around eight o'clock and told us that we were arrested and in the name of the people, we should pack what we should take and they would pick us up in a hour which was really two and a half or three hours. So they -- the people were fairly decent. They gave many people enough time to pack, half-way reasonably. They explained we should take stuff along which was warm. We were allowed to take what we can carry, plus 100 marks, plus I believe food for two or three days. They came. They picked us up. We were brought to I think it was a railroad station and then we were loaded into passenger trains no less and this was an action which related to all German Jews in Baden, in the State of Baden, and the Palatinate; the two Nazi officials who -- or the Nazi official who was responsible for these two states wanted to be one of he first ones to report that he has no more Jews in his state. So we were loaded. We, we went into this special train, and it was one of seven trains which, if I remember right which was to go to France and shortly before we departed, an SS officer appeared in our car  \\\"7 Schutzstaffeln [Protection Squads] (German) -- why he came to our car I don't know, was haphazardly -- and picked out a man who wore in his lapel a sign which identified him as a, a German war veteran of World War I.  He appointed him chief of the train. So when the train left, we went first through the Alsace in Mulhouse the SS appeared, threatening us and changing -- exchanging our money and telling us that if any money would be found on anybody in excess; of the 100 marks, we were permitted to take the person -- people would be arrested and shot. But nobody -- they never searched anybody, and there were indeed probably a number of people who gambled and had more money on them. So our 100 marks were exchanged for 2000 French francs and then we went on. We came to Lyon and apparently, we were the first train so when in Lyon, the French gendarmarie which was at the station looked for some spokesman. The man who was appointed the transport chief identified himself and asked me to translate because he didn't speak French. So it turned out these -- the French were not notified by the Germans. They were -- the French were told that there are Alsatians coming who don't want to stay under the German rule. But that was all they were told. They didn't know numbers. They didn't know that this was a lie. They were dumbfounded when they found that there were German Jews in this train and this was one train and, of course, they didn't know there were six others coming. So they gave us some food, and then the trains went on. Actually, we were deported on the 22nd and we got to Oloron, which is the closest railroad station to the camp on the 25th, so we were three days in this train and we came -- we arrived in Oloron in a down pour which was unbelievable and we were put on trucks and taken to camp, which turned out to be Camp de Gurs. For identification purposes, let's say that Camp de Gurs is in the south of France about 40 or 60 miles from the Spanish border.  At Gurs we -- when we unloaded in front of the camp, it was still raining. And so it was -- I believe it was evening, and so we were taken into the camp and distributed into a camp block, 30 or 40 people into one block. All we found was an empty barracks. All the barracks were empty. There was some straw and they gave us empty covers and we had to do -- we had to fill them to have a straw mattress. And the ground in Gurs is -- I don't know how to describe it. There was very little there were -- there was one central street. The camp incidentally was built by -- by the Spanish for the Spanish refugees. And so we were dumped into these barracks and that was the end of it. There was a -- at the beginning we had milit-- paramilitary gendarmeries there who guarded us and, of course, men and women were separated. It took awhile to sort out where everybody was, but eventually we found out where -- where our -- the members of our families were. I was deported with my mother and Incidentally, my grandmother had to leave Germany abruptly on September 1, 1939, because she was a French citizen. She tried to get into Switzerland where she had a sister, but Switzerland had imposed visa requirements and she couldn't go into Switzerland so she ended up in an old age home in Nancy and eventually she went to Bordeaux. And from Bordeaux she joined my father in Nice and eventually she set up household with him in Nice, and she died in Nice.  My grandmother was born on January 27, 1970, so she was about --  1870. So she was she was about 73 or 74. I think 73.  Well, the beginning, of course, was very chaotic. We didn't -- and the first night, we didn't even have our luggage. The luggage was brought the next morning. It was just dumped in the rain and we had to pull our -- you know, it was lying in a big pile and he had to find our luggage. And which I did for both myself and my mother. And so my mother was in one block and I was in the other, and there was nothing to do, of course. We could not get out of the block. And I was here and my mother was a few hundred _ yards further north in another block with the women. And by the time all of the transports had finally arrived there were over 7,000 or 8,000 people in the, in the camp for which the authorities had, of course, very little advance warning because nobody knew we were coming. Well, eventually things settled down. Every time it rained people would fall in the mud, particularly the old people. The food was abominable. We had very little to eat. The French had nothing to eat, so we had even less.  And since a friend of my father was the vice chief of the block where I was in, I managed eventually to get myself occupied by working in the office in the -- each block had its own administrative office and I managed to work in the office. The one advantage of this was that it was warm. There was no heating material, but the offices had, of course, more heat so during the day I was reasonably warm while I was working there. And periodically, maybe once or twice a week, you managed to get enough -- a pass to visit members of your family in the other block and my mother worked in the block office where she was because the woman who was picked as the chief of the block had only one qualification. She spoke fluent French. She was probably the only one who spoke as fluent as French as she did. My mother spoke French obviously, so she managed to be this woman who spoke so fluent French managed to become the block head of the block which had benefits. You had a barrack. At night the barrack was yours. She had alone -- she lived alone in this big barrack which during the day was the office and somehow or other, all of the block chiefs ate better or most of them. They just took food out of the kitchen and life settled down. There wasn't very much to do. Eventually I managed -- we managed to get musical instruments and we started to play a quartet and in this respect, I must say, the French administration, who really showed not very much sympathy organized to have one barrack in each block as a cultural, as a cultural barrack so you had lectures. We gave concerts, and for me it was very good because the moment I was a part of a quartet, I had a permanent pass and I could circulate in camp. And the instruments came from the YMCA'* who, who were with other organizations very active in trying to ameliorate our fate.  I played cello. I still do. I met my wife in camp.  Oh, my wife worked in, in the -- she was a messenger, I believe, in the, in the office where my mother worked, so when -- I met her when I visited my mother. And eventually the Secours Suisse\\u2019\\u201d, or rather the Swiss Red Cross who had sent a nurse -- Elsbeth Kasser, she is still alive -- set up in a barrack, breakfast for the young generation. And that was really -- I don't remember now if we got it once or if we got it daily or if we got it two or three times a week, but we got a supplementary feeding which helped many of us survive better. So, every morning I would come -- I would -- we were permitted, of course, to leave the -- the block for this. We would I would pick up my wife at the end of the -- her block. We would walk together to the barrack to have our food and come back, and I would see my wife every time when I obviously we weren't married then -- when I would visit my mother or if I came to visit to see her. We met in a -- I met her in, I think, it was December of 1940, so this is now 50 years.  No. We saw each other fairly frequently since I could circulate. She worked. I think she, she will tell you that herself. She was giving out mail. She was running errands. I worked in the office and she was able to leave well before me. She left in, I think, in September of \\u201841. I am not sure about the date. She will tell you.  You take that up with her.  8 Young Men\\u2019s Christian Association  '\\u00b0 Swiss Aid (French)  I was still in my block. However, eventually the French authorities needed to stage an example on -- for everybody's benefit to limit corruption. By corruption I mean the two chiefs in my block and one chief's wife were really stealing food from the block and lived very well. And there were French inspectors who noticed this and eventually this became -- was very pervasive. I believe it was done in almost every block with the exception of one. And the French became concerned with this, so since other things happened about which I am not quite sure what happened. They caught them in all kinds of unethical things. They decided to stage an example and to get rid of these people, the block was dissolved. And one morning before some movement of people started, the redistribution of our entire block to other blocks started. The French inspector who was responsible for our block, stood in front of me and asked me if I would do a job for him. The job was I had to inventory -- do the inventory for the whatever little equipment there was. Which I did. It was my first experience with inventory. Little did I know that in my later life, inventory would play a big role because in accounting, inventory is a very important feature. And so when this was done and I had given him all the lists and all the equipment, He said to me, \\\"I will thank you in kind. I will take care of you.\\\" Now I don't have something for you at the moment.\\\" He knew I was working at the office, of course. Otherwise, I wouldn't have gotten that job. \\\"But I will take care of you.\\\" So I was put into really a terrible block mostly with people who were not from the group of German Jews who were other people who were interned there. And I was there about three weeks, very unhappy. Fortunately, I had my pass and I could get out when I wanted to get out to see my mother and.... Well, one day three weeks later, he stood again in front of me, \\\"I haven't forgotten you. I have a job for you. We'll move you to the hospital and you can do the office in the hospital.\\\" This was a very privileged position because I shared the -- the room. I had a room in a barrack, but it was a room with a door with our own stove with a bed. Had only a straw mattress, but it was a bed while we slept basically on little wooden platforms which the Spanish refugees had made for us for money with barbed wire where the barbs were taken out and the wire was used as, as a mattress support.  So there I had a hospital bed. We could light a fire in the evening during the day and I shared the room with a man who was really responsible for -- he was really the, the block chief for the hospital to the extent that this was necessary. This was basically the job of accompanying really sick people who had to be evacuated to a hospital to ride the ambulance daily back and forth to either Oloron, which was the closest point to a doctor or to the hospital in Pau. And eventually I also was able to commute once in awhile out of the camp and with the ambulance, breathe some fresh air. In retrospect, of course, it was stupid I never took my mother along. I -- if | would have taken my mother along and gone with her to Pau, we could have managed probably to escape and join my father in Nice. But being Germans, it never occurred to us. Eventually in -- I was approached or my mother was approached -- if I could leave -- if there would apply -- a space some -- somewhere a place could be found for me if I would be permitted to leave my mother and get -- to get out of camp and, of course, she consented to that. And so in probably in July of 1942 after 20 months I left camp with the same social worker who escorted Hanne and her group to Le Chambon, and was bought to Talluyers. Talluyers is a small village outside of Lyon. With me was one other young fellow about a year or a year and a half younger than I was. And the two of us were brought to a farm which was run by the Jewish Boy Scouts of France. It was a working farm. There were a lot of young people there. The one problem we had with the farm was neither he nor I were Orthodox and this was not an Orthodox farm, but an ultra-Orthodox farm. They didn't let us work too much because they knew we were so skinny, we couldn't have worked anyway. And around the end of July, the very end of July, my girlfriend came from Gurs having obtained permission to visit her mother and I saw her then for the first time after about a year. And when she came back from the camp, she came again to tell me that her mother was deported. She could not enter camp. She will tell you that herself. And we arranged then and there that if there would be problems for me that I should try to make my way to where she was because she felt certain that there would be help for anybody who is up there in Le Chambon. Now, you must remember this was -- she was, of course, in 1942, she was just 17 and since people didn't talk about what was going on, it was just the feeling she had and she knew there would be help.  What we didn't know was that about a week or two after she had left we -- an announcement was made by the management of the farm that they were notified that in about two weeks or two and a half weeks, there would be raids on the farm and all the foreign Jews would be arrested, which meant all of us, of course. But not to worry, that we would be helped by hiding. But when the time came to disperse everybody, help was indeed forthcoming for everybody but four of us -- my friend from Gurs and two other somewhat older young fellows who were not Orthodox -- we were told to help ourselves. What was interesting is that these people who were running the camp -- it was an Alsatian Jew and two Rabbis who - - because they are still alive I won't mention their names -- German Rabbis, who were in Gurs who are mentioned by name in, in -- as being very helpful while they were in Gurs -- in a book by Schramm\\u201d about her experiences in Gurs and but there was no help for us. We were told, \\\"Do what you feel is right. Go wherever you want to go.\\\" And that was the end for that. So my friend and I from Gurs, Gurs, we went to Le Chambon, which wasn't so far away from there, because all we knew Hanne had explained to us, we leave to go to Saint Etienne and in Saint Etienne I believe there was a train going up to Le Chambon.  The farm management.  Took care -- took care of all of the other people. In fact, I understand that most of these people today are in Israel, including the principals.  It was probably 5, four or five weeks. I have a very hazy recollection. I really don't remember much. It was obviously much better than it was in camp but you know, I am not the one who is at ease in any farm. I am not the type.  Oh, yeah. but to -- to finish up with the farm. We were -- Hanne and I and our daughter was in, in New York. We were in New York only a very short time, a few weeks. We were walking down Broadway, pushing the baby carriage when we ran into the two rabbis who were in Talluyers and whom al-- of course, we also knew from Gurs.  These are the two rabbis who did, did nothing to help. And their reaction was actually very interesting because if they could have sunk into the earth to disappear when they saw us and we started to talk with them for a minute or two, they would have really disappeared because they visibly had a bad conscience when they saw us.  So, we left the farm early in the morning and by 10 o'clock at night, we were in the Le Chambon.  Well, it was 10 o'clock. Where I am going to find Hanne at 10 o'clock at night? I don't even know where she is. So, we decided we're going to sleep. There was a little wooded opening in the middle of nowhere, and we decided that we are going to put our sleeping bags down and we're going to sleep there. And we did. Around four-thirty, five o\\u2019clock, five-fifteen in the morning, we hear -- we had just woken up and we had just folded up our sleeping bags when we hear girls' voices passing on the path where we were in the in the little wood and who walked by? Hanne! With a few of the teenage girls who were with her in the little children's home in, in Le Chambon.  And so I whistled after her because I had to run first to, to catch her and she absolutely refused to turn around. Her girlfriend, who knew me, saw me and tried to stop Hanne walking on and so eventually she physically turned her around. There was I was. So Hanne took us to Madame Andr\\u00e9 Philip\\u201d , who she apparently -- she knew her, and she figured she would be a logical person to, to help. So Mireille asked her only one question  No. I don't know what happened to them.  I know. No. I don't know really what happened to them.  Oh, yeah. Where? In, in, in Switzerland, I was in many internment camps and we can -- I can read them off to you. I have this--  Was Sierre.  Well, the camp was set up really to clear land, to make land arable because there was a great shortage of food in Switzerland. You know, they had to be more or less self supporting and I am really not familiar with the dates. We can -- I can show you the dates afterwards on my -- when we take a photo of the identifications -- Swiss identification papers. Well, when I came back, it had snowed. There were about two or three feet of snow. And the first thing we had to do was to clear the road from the camp to the street -- to the main highway and I didn't very much appreciate this. I don't like physical labor. So I decided at that point already that this is not for me. I got to do something about it.  And I managed to get, within two weeks, I was in the office. They needed somebody in the office because there was a great deal of administrative work to be done on a daily basis. There was rationing and you had to do rationing reports which had to be typed a certain way in order to get the rationing tickets to which we all were entitled to or the camp was entitled to, so there was a great deal of administrative work to be done. So I went into the office. And I was in offices in refuge camps or homes for the rest of my Swiss stay for five and one half years. I was in -- the only time I was out was a few months while I was -- where I was in Geneva where I took some social services courses. We -- one did not know what would be. I had no profession basically. So when the opportunity came to take some courses in social service, I took the opportunity. I was put in the pension in Geneva and I took these courses. Incidentally, we also got married during this period in Geneva.  Well, Hanne came in February of -- February 28, 1943. She will tell you she came a different way. The difference between her and me was that I came and remained an illegal alien in Switzerland for the entire five and a half years we were in Switzerland while the moment Hanne set foot on Swiss soil, she was legal because her relatives had procured a Swiss visa. We managed to get permission after I was married. After all, I knew the ropes, how to do these things. I was in the offices all this time. I got permission to bring her .with me, to live with me. Then eventually they decided since she is really not an internee, and a -- but a legal  foreigner, she could not live with me. Then we had to go through the charade of having a room, renting a room in Montreux would cost a lot of money. We had to pay for the room, which she didn't use once. She stayed with me in, in the home where I was. Eventually, we were able to give up the room again.  And after the social services course we came -- I went back to a refuge home in the office. I was assigned again to an office, to run an office and she came along. By the way, while I was, while I was in Geneva and Hanne was in Geneva -- and the circumstances of Hanne staying in Geneva she will tell you herself -- we, all of a sudden, we are approached by -- now I can't think of the name of the man -- by a German Gentile. I believe he was Gentile. And we were not married at the time yet. Hanne will probably supply the name. I can't think of it right now. He invited us for tea twice, and he was really trying to recruit us. The war would end soon. It was in 1944 or early 1945, and why wouldn't we come to East Germany where the Russians were to help build up East Germany? And we got into a rather lengthy discussion twice about the merits of going into an authoritarian dictatorship. I pointed out to Siberia and the camps in Siberia which the man tried not to play down, of course. And eventually, I made -- we made it clear to him that we are not interested. What is interesting about these two interviews is that about 20 years later, we are reading an obituary in the New York Times about the right hand of Mr. Brandt\\u201d\\u2019, who was German Prime Minister, and it was this man and the obituary related that after the war, he came back to East Germany, eventually ran afoul of the Russian authorities, was in Siberia, somehow when he was released managed to get to West Germany and became the right hand man of Mr. Brandt. So,  22 Willy Brandt (nee Herbert Ernst Karl Frahm) Hanne and I got married in Geneva in -- on April 14, 1945. Our daughter was born in March of 1946, and in 1948 in -- after we had obtained our visas for the United States, we came here.  We came to New York and we stayed in New York. In the beginning, you know, I was told, \\\"Go to HIAS\\u2122, Maybe they can help you.\\\" And we went, and the suggestion was made, \\\"Why don't you go to Pritoria -- Peoria ?\\\" Peoria, Illinois. Well, first, of course, no where -- I didn't know anything. For the first two weeks so I permitted myself the question, \\\"Who\\u2019s going to pay for all of this?\\\" \\u201cWell, your relatives, of course.\\u201d So, we never went to Peoria, Illinois. We stayed in New York.  No. Probably after we all finish with the interview tomorrow or the day after, I probably can think of all kinds of things which I forgot, but right now --  Yeah, I realize that. We will, we will Hanne her passports and I will just show mine, my two. And then we'll show the travel document yet.  No. That is much, much -- No. That is five years ago, four years ago.  It's not of consequence to--  This is my internal refugee pass for Switzerland. It contained identification with a picture. It shows--  3 United Hebrew Sheltering and Immigrant Aid Society.  Longer? Okay. Raise your hand when, when you want me --  It shows that there were always periods given in which we are permitted to remain in Switzerland. It was always a year or so and then it had to be renewed, which was a formality because they know, they know we couldn't go anywhere. It shows here, for instance, that we were interned by order of the police -- the federal police really. This is the record of all of the refugee camps and the homes where I was in from. And it finally has pages which shows what rationing cards were issued to me. Because after all, the Swiss are worse bureaucrats than the Germans. Now finally, on this page are three numbers. One is a number which -- under which I went while I was interned in these camps or homes. Actually I was more in formal hotels which due to the war were empty and where refugees were housed. One of those numbers is a police department number from the federal police. My -- I had an aunt who lived in Switzerland, who was married in Switzerland, who gave on the occasion of one of her visits a passport application where we had tried for me to come to Zurich to study at the conservatory of music. And as we discovered, this was a number which was given to me by the Swiss when I became -- when I came into Switzerland. Not only this, but when Hanne married me, all of sudden she -- this same number turned up on her refugee pass. We never were told anything about it, but you know the Swiss are very subtle. And since we had to fill out when we came a questionnaire of maybe 30 pages, they were able to trace back who we were and they matched my passport application from 1939 to my arrival in 1942 in Switzerland. Now, the other thing I wanted to show yet is the passport I used or we were issued in Switzerland since we refused to accept German papers. I did not want a German passport. I wanted no part of Germany. So this is the Swiss travel document which was used for us to obtain our American visa which is in here. It's just like a regular passport. It had our transit visa and our immigration visa. This is the immigration visa into the United States signed by the same man who had been promoted from Vice Consul to Consul who in Germany gave untold people untold trouble. I don't know if this ever was mentioned in an interview, but to obtain a immigration visa in those days in Germany was an extremely harrowing experience. Any pretext would be used to deny a visa. People would come with their children. The child might have bumped her arm or his leg and there would be a blue mark. This was enough, during the physical examination which was given in the Consulate in Stuttgart and in Berlin, to reject an application or to postpone an application for three, or four, or five months.  That's it.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",
