    "BoW is one of the most basic and simplest approaches to represent text.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We create a **vocabulary** of all unique words in the dataset.\n",
    "- Each document (or sentence) is represented as a **vector** and it has a length equal to the vocabulary size.\n",
    "- Each position in the vector corresponds to a word, and the value is filled with counts that represents how often it appears in the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Corpus:\n",
    "1. \"The cat sat\"\n",
    "2. \"The dog barked\"\n",
    "3. \"The cat meowed\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Vocabulary: \\[ \\text{\"the\"}, \\text{\"cat\"}, \\text{\"sat\"}, \\text{\"dog\"}, \\text{\"barked\"}, \\text{\"meowed\"} \\]\n",

    "These are individual words. For example, in the sentence \"The cat sat\", the unigrams are:\n",

    "**Bigrams:**\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**TF-IDF** improves BoW by not just counting word frequency, but also considering how **important** a word is across documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let:\n",
    "- tf(t, d): Term frequency = how often term \\( t \\) appears in document \\( d \\)\n",
    "- idf(t): Inverse Document Frequency = how rare the term is across documents\n",
    "\n",
    "**TF-IDF**:\n",
    "- $\\text{TF(term frequency)} = \\frac{\\text{no. of times w appears in a doc}}{\\text{no. of times w appears in all the docs}}$\n",
    "- $\\text{IDF(Inverse doc freq)(t)}= log(\\frac{\\text{N=totaldocs}}{\\text{no. of docs have w in it}}) = \\log \\left( \\frac{N}{df(t)} \\right)$\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s important to understand that IDF in TF-IDF reduces the weight of common words that frequently appear in most documents within the corpus, as these words contribute little to document classification. Conversely, it highlights less common words, making them more important for distinguishing the documents in which they appear.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\text{TF-IDF}(t, d) = tf(t, d) \\times idf(t)\n",

    "- \\( N \\): Total number of documents\n",
    "- \\( df(t) \\): document frequency of the term i.e Number of documents containing the term \\( t \\)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intuition:\n",
    "- Common words like \"the\", \"is\", \"in\" will have **low IDF**, reducing their weight.\n",
    "- Rare but meaningful words like \"quantum\", \"neural\" will have **high IDF**, boosting their score.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Pros:\n",
    "- Adds weighting to reflect importance\n",
    "\n",

Here, the model built by us will learn the mean and variance of the features of the training set. These learned parameters are then used to scale our test data.\n",

    "Now, we want scaling to be applied to our test data too and at the same time do not want to be biased with our model. We want our test data to be a completely new and a surprise set for our model. The transform method helps us in this case. Using the transform method we can use the same mean and variance as it is calculated from our training data to transform our test data. Thus, the parameters learned by our model using the training data will help us to transform our test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we will use the fit method on our test data too, we will compute a new mean and variance that is a new scale for each feature and will let our model learn about our test data too. Thus, what we want to keep as a surprise is no longer unknown to our model and we will not get a good estimate of how our model is performing on the test (unseen) data which is the ultimate goal of building a model using machine learning algorithm."
