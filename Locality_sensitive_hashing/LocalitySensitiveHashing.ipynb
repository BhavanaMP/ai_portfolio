Apply \"universal hashing\" to perform minhashing on a shingle set\n","    3. can be called like a function to compute a **signature matrix**\n","4. Evaluate MinHashing effectiveness by computing scores of all pairs\n","5. Introduce LSH for finding **candidate pairs**, i.e. use a banded signature matrix to find all pairs whose similarity is likely above a threshold\n","6. Make this efficient, by using hash table for band, column ids, allowing O(n) comparison\n","\n","Part II: computing similarity amongst vectors\n","\n","* Afterwards, we provide an additional LSH family for Euclidean spaces, namely cosine similarity. \n","* This is used to ascertain the similarity of vectors in a D-dimensional space.\n","* Can be implemented using the *Random Hyperplanes* hashing method."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":3,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":1754,"status":"ok","timestamp":1655243217866,"user":{"displayName":"Bhavana Malla","userId":"13569433150164017713"},"user_tz":-120},"id":"pj7AbduRDMLc","outputId":"e0129066-e8ae-48ca-8f52-33e128fca937"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Drive already mounted at /content/drive; to attempt to forcibly remount, call drive.mount(\"/content/drive\", force_remount=True).\n"]}],"source":["from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":3,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":315,"status":"ok","timestamp":1655241035500,"user":{"displayName":"Bhavana Malla","userId":"13569433150164017713"},"user_tz":-120},"id":"HSVp_cYh2IbA","outputId":"fcbe32a7-4516-4a69-b6b1-37b8a47b1f01"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/ATIML/Locality-sensitive-hashing-tutorial\n"]}],"source":["%cd /content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/ATIML/Locality-sensitive-hashing-tutorial"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":4,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":344,"status":"ok","timestamp":1655241038771,"user":{"displayName":"Bhavana Malla","userId":"13569433150164017713"},"user_tz":-120},"id":"1SCB_jXsDGNz"},"outputs":[],"source":["import os\n","import time\n","import itertools\n","import collections\n","import numpy as np\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"YiewMRZFDGN0"},"source":["# Part I: document similarity"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"B7ZMPS8lDGN1"},"source":["## MinHashing without Locality Sensitive Hashing"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"-urWl_JkDGN1"},"source":["### Shingling\n","\n","We illustrate how to convert a word document into a list of shingles.\n","We will use three similar strings, and see how this shows similarity.\n","I made a directory and copied 4 files from CNN, then the 5th is a concatenation of 3 of them, randomly deleting some lines"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":34,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":309,"status":"ok","timestamp":1655242194963,"user":{"displayName":"Bhavana Malla","userId":"13569433150164017713"},"user_tz":-120},"id":"EGiaoOrHDGN1","outputId":"3c6572f7-d07b-407f-d8e1-43add0faa4fc"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/ATIML/Locality-sensitive-hashing-tutorial/sampledocs/\n","Investigators with the Manhattan district attorney's office have interviewed several employees at President Donald Trump's lender and insurer in recent weeks as part of a wide-ranging investigation into the Trump Organization, according to multiple people familiar with the investigation.\n","\n","Two employees of Deutsche Bank, which has loaned more than $300 million to the Trump Organization, were interviewed by prosecutors, according to sources familiar with the matter.\n","The interviews took place after the November presidential election, the people said, and focused on general questions about how bankers assess loans and underwriting criteria.\n","The questioning was not specific to the bank's dealing with the Trump Organization or the President, the people said, with one person adding that it was the beginning of the process. Additional interviews are expected in the near future, they said.\n","Prosecutors also interviewed at least one employee at Aon, an insurance broker who has done work with the President's company, according to one source familiar with the matter.\n","A spokeswoman for Aon confirmed the company received a subpoena and said it is cooperating with the investigation. The spokeswoman declined to comment on any employee interviews. Representatives for Deutsche Bank and the district attorney's office, led by Cyrus Vance, also declined to comment. Deutsche Bank was subpoenaed as part of the investigation last year and has said it cooperates with authorized investigations.\n","The New York Times first reported on the interviews with Deutsche Bank and Aon employees.\n","The interviews with Trump counterparties comes as prosecutors wait for a decision by the US Supreme Court over a grand jury subpoena for the President's tax returns. The President has lost several legal challenges in an attempt to block the subpoena to Mazars USA, his long-time accounting firm, for eight years of his personal and business records and tax returns.\n","Last month, the 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals denied Trump's latest effort to block the subpoena paving the way for it to be enforced. The President's lawyers have asked the Supreme Court to stay, or halt, the ruling and a decision is expected any day.\n","The Mazars records are critical to the investigation, prosecutors have said. The Manhattan district attorney investigation is the only criminal inquiry facing Trump, his business and his family and will continue after he leaves office. Trump has had discussions about issuing pardons to his family members and possibly himself, CNN has reported, but those pardons would not insulate him from a state criminal indictment.\n","In court filings the district attorney's office has suggested the inquiry could involve tax fraud, insurance fraud and schemes to defraud its lenders. They also recently subpoenaed the Trump Organization for records relating to fees it has paid to consultants, including a payment made to a company controlled by the President's daughter, Ivanka Trump, according to people familiar with the matter.\n","The Trump Organization has denied any wrongdoing and said applicable taxes were paid.\n","Last year prosecutors with the district attorney's office interviewed Michael Cohen, the President's former personal attorney, at least three times about his knowledge of the Trump Organization's business dealings.\n","Cohen testified before Congress in February 2019 that the Trump Organization allegedly manipulated its financial statements to suit its desired outcomes. Cohen said Trump \"deflated his assets to reduce his real estate taxes.\" And he alleged company officials would play with the financial numbers when dealing with insurance companies and Deutsche Bank.\n","Specifically, Cohen alleged the President inflated the value of his assets at times, including in 2014 when Trump submitted documents to Deutsche Bank as part of an attempt to bid for the Buffalo Bills football team. Trump never did the loan.\n","Cohen pleaded guilty to federal crimes, including campaign finance charges for facilitating hush-money payments to silence two woman's allegations of affairs with Trump. Trump has denied the affairs.

the latest south korean proposal for  resumption of interkorean talks seems to reflect an effort by  the north korean regime to score polemical points against the  south and its ongoing preference for negotiating with washington  over seoul on the nuclear issue                               end summary      apparently violating a recent dprkus agreement pyongyang  countered seouls proposal for a  march workinglevel contact  with a later date a counterproposal that seemed aimed mainly at  gaining some perceived polemical advantage over seoul  according  to pyongyang radio on  march pak yongsu north korean chief  delegate to the proposed workinglevel talks sent a telephone  message to his southern counterpart proposing a meeting on   march  pyongyangs attempt to delay the northsouth meeting for  two days seemed to violate an agreement it had reportedly reached  with washington for resumption of highlevel dprkus talks  the   february agreement announced by pyongyang radio on   february specified  march as the date the following will take  place simultaneously       seoul will announce its decision to discontinue this years  running of team spirit and washington will announce its consent  to seouls decision       the international atomic energy agency will start nuclear  inspections in the north to ensure continuity of safeguards       interkorean contacts will start at panmunjom to discuss  exchanging of special presidential envoys       pyongyang and washington will announce resumption of highlevel  bilateral talks to take place on  march in geneva      pyongyangs motives in proposing a later date for northsouth  contacts pyongyang may have been showing its concern about  appearing to cave in to pressure on the issue of nuclear  inspections and its continued reluctance to deal with anyone but  washington on the nuclear issue  in the latest attempt to  portray seoul as irrelevant on the nuclear issue the party paper  nodong sinmun in a  february commentary ridiculed rok president  kim yongsam for allegedly acting as if he receives us reports  on dprkus talks and as if he controls the talks pyongyang  radio  february  kim creates this impression the commentary  added even though he is not even qualified to join the talks      pyongyangs reluctance to engage seoul in anything of substance  was also evident in the sheer contempt for president kim north  korea expressed in commenting on kims  february press  conference commemorating the first year of his presidency  departing from its past practice of avoiding extreme personal  attacks on south korean leaders during periods of interkorean  dialogue the north korean news agency kcna on  february heaped  abuse on president kim calling him inter alia a traitor a  puppet and a political mountebank accusing him of arch  crimes of flunkeyism treachery fascism repression and  promoting national division and confrontation and  of plain  stupidity  kcna went on to claim that kims remarks about the  probable absence of nuclear arms in the north and his proposal  for an interkorean summit constituted a de facto admission that  his criminal policy against the north had been wrong  the  party paper nodong sinmun on  february similarly ridiculed  kims preposterously absurd remarks pyongyang radio      dprkus talks in sharp contrast to its reluctance to meet  with seoul pyongyang was upbeat about the prospect of upcoming  talks with washington  although monitored pyongyang media have  not commented on the news of the upcoming highlevel bilateral  talks ambassador ho chong deputy chief of north koreas mission  to the united nations was depicted in south korean media as  being optimistic about the eventual outcome of the negotiations  in an interview with the seoul daily hangyore sinmun   february ho termed it fortunate that washington although  belatedly withdrew unjustified preconditions to resumption of  the highlevel talks thus paving way for a package solution of  not only the nuclear issue but also other issues now standing  in the way of diplomatic normalization      implications pyongyangs contrasting media treatment of  washington and seoul indicates that the north korean leadership  continues to prefer the united states as partner for nuclear  negotiations and is inclined to limit talks with the south to the  minimum required to fulfill preconditions

decried the  publicity given to the case by highlevel us officials saying  that incidents such as the ames case should be handled by  intelligence agencies without involving officials at higher  levels       according to itartass on  february foreign minister andrey  kozyrev said that it would be better to let the intelligence  services handle the case and not to politicize or ideologize the  situation  he emphasized that it is important for the united  states and russia to continue to cooperate and not to attach  undue hypertrophied significance to this case  after the  russians expelled a us embassy officer in retaliation for the  us expulsion of a russian embassy official in washington  kozyrev reiterated these views and claimed moscow had to resort  to a reciprocal expulsion but this process of reciprocity  should be eliminated the sooner the better itartass   february       a  february foreign ministry press statement sniped at us  handling of the case criticizing attempts by the special  services to drag the political leadership into their mutual  relations and noted that there are appropriate channels that  can be brought fully into use to deal with such cases  the  statement said that if as reported the investigation of ames  had begun ten months ago this was sufficient time for us to be  contacted directly and for us officials to share their  anxieties with us before making them public itartass   february       russian foreign intelligence service fis officials refused  to comment directly on ames but expressed surprise that the  united states made such an outcry over actions fis officials  described as common practice for all intelligence services  fis  director yevgeniy primakov had no comment on the case itar  tass  february  fis press spokesman yuriy kobaladze noted  that declining to comment on such allegations is the general  practice among intelligence services and stressed there is  nothing new or sensational here in the fact that

that washington has been very active in intelligence  activity in russia and the other newly independent states      breaking ranks at least temporarily with other officials  mikhail kolesnikov chief of the russian general staff  acknowledged ames links to russia but later retracted this  admission  a  february itartass report quoted kolesnikov as  saying ames worked in the unitedstates for russia but  nonetheless claiming that he had inflicted no direct damage on  the united states  on  february however kolesnikov stated  that the general staff and its intelligence service have no  information on any links between ames and soviet or russian  intelligence agencies  according to itartass kolesnikov went  on to claim that us media misinterpreted his  february  statement itartass  february      russian media      russian media across the political spectrum indignantly  criticized us handling of the case and speculated sometimes on  the basis of comments by unnamed officials that the united  states had ulterior motives in timing the public exposure of  ames  some commentators said that us officials had exposed the  case now because they wanted to create a pretext to reevaluate  usrussian relations in the wake of the recent slowdown of  reform in russia while others alleged that the united states  wanted to take the gloss off russias diplomatic success in  brokering a compromise over sarajevo  media commentary even in  publications like izvestiya a strong supporter of russian  efforts to integrate with the west supported the russian  government position and criticized the united states       a  february article in izvestiya remarked on what it saw as  the hypocrisy of us reaction to the ames case since it  claimed russia has no less right to secret operations in the  united states than america has to espionage in russia  a   february article on the case headlined the question why is  washington making a fuss and cited competent sources as  speculating that the ames arrest was an attempt to put moscow in  its place after russian diplomacy in bosnia for the first time  in recent years cast the united states in a secondary role       a  february article in the government newspaper rossiyskaya  gazeta worried that the ames case is being given political  overtones reminiscent of the   incident which triggered  a sharp downturn in ussoviet relations  the article claimed  that certain forces in the united states were trying to  exaggerate this affair because they are unhappy with the new  chernomyrdin government and with yeltsins bosnia initiative  which had thwarted the hawks attempt to resolve the serbian  question through air strikes and had suddenly and very sharply  increased russias political weight in the international arena  the article concluded however that both the us and russian  presidents were demonstrating a wellbalanced approach and  expressed hope that political relations between the two countries  would not be aggravated       a  february article in the defense ministrys newspaper  krasnaya zvezda cited several theories advanced by unnamed  experts to explain the us ballyhoo over the case  the  article claimed us intelligence agencies wished to get even  after the exposure of more than  foreign intelligence agents  including us spies in the last year  an article on   february charged that the fuss over the routine event of a  double agents exposure is taking on an increasingly hysterical  character in the united states claiming with obvious sarcasm  that langley believes that only  have the right to  carry out intelligence activity  prominent krasnaya zvezda  observer aleksandr golts in a commentary published on  march  implicitly took issue with this analysis however claiming  instead that it is russias newly demonstrated foreign policy  independence that has driven washington berserk  golts  contended that the united states is publicizing the ames case  because russias efforts to implement an active foreign policy  course with its successful initiative in the balkans had put  the united states on the sidelines after it had become  accustomed to feeling that it is the only world leader the only  superpower  he concluded by advocating the vital necessity of  a partnership with the rules of conduct  the same for  everyone       the independent proreform newspaper segodnya in a   february article warned that the ames case would revive the old  outcry that the russians cannot be trusted  the article  linked the case to yeltsins bosnia initiative particularly his  proposal for a summit on the issue  claiming that yeltsins  summit proposal would be inconvenient for western leaders the  article implied that the ames scandal had been whipped up to  remove the russian initiative from the agenda  a  march  article cited unnamed sources as saying that russian security  services are not interested in arousing passions but that  influential us forces are hoping to impose a timeout for  the united states to reexamine its policy toward russia       in an interview published in the  february edition of the  labororiented newspaper trud retired kgb major general boris  solomatin citing examples of other spy cases where there was no  official outcry bitterly ascribed what he called washingtons  inappropriate reaction to the ames affair to us imperial  thinking about russia  lamenting that russia had been  transformed from an equal power whose intelligence services  could work against those of the united states to one which now  has to ask permission to do so solomatin complained that the  us attitude is we can you cannot because we have the money  and you have an outstretched hand  contending that the united  states had not given much thought to the possible consequences  when it embarked on this scandal solomatin claimed that now  when russians see that the big bucks spent on intelligence are  working they will recognize the importance of intelligence and  begin to organize it properly      implications      the pains taken by russian officials to play down the ames affair  and to minimize its effect on usrussian relations clearly  indicate moscows desire to keep the relationship on a firm  footing  however the indignant reaction on the part of both  officials and the media to the us handling of the case as well  as the sensitivity displayed toward perceived attempts to  relegate russia to a marginal role in diplomacy or intelligence  activities indicates that moscow will continue to assert itself  when it feels that the united states is trying to take unfair  advantage   author  bellinger  questions andor comments please call  chief analysis branch russia division    eneagbloughta  mar

broadcast media  the new television and radio  service under yakovlev will be subordinate to the president  while the edict appointing poptsov to head rtv extends yeltsins  appointment powers to an area once held by the supreme soviet  presidium  the creation of efir consolidates state control  over the television broadcast infrastructure under a presidential  appointee and the new information appeals court gives the  president a potentially great advantage over the other branches  of government in determining the political slant and content of  television programming      profile lowered      by giving the new press committee and broadcast service sub  cabinet rank and moving out mikhail poltoranin and vladimir  shumeyko two favorite targets of his opponents yeltsin appears  to be attempting to move the media and media policy away from the  front lines of the political struggle  poltoranin as chief of  the now defunct federal information center fic and shumeyko  as head of the now abolished ministry of the press and  information both held ministerial rank but neither of the heads  of the new bodies has ministerial rank or cabinet status      new bodies powers      the reorganization gives the new broadcasting service the  preeminent role in regulating broadcast media eliminating  overlapping responsibilities that existed under the former  structures  from the fic the broadcast service inherits the  functions of coordinating state policy for television and  radio assisting in the provision of objective information to  domestic and international audiences on russian political and  economic issues and participating in the process of drafting  legislation on the broadcast media  from the press and  information ministry the service inherits responsibilities for  implementing state television and radio broadcasting policy and  for television and radio licensing and registration  the service  also has authority to administer government financing and  subsidies for national and regional television rossiyskiye  vesti  december  but its authority has been severely  circumscribed by the ministry of finance see box   the   december edict names the committee on the press the legal  successor to both the ministry of press and information and the  fic but does not elaborate its functions in detail  it  presumably will assume the fic and press ministry functions that  relate specifically to the press  the edict does explicitly  establish that the committee will administer government financing  and subsidies formerly a prerogative of the

representatives of  ostankino and russian television    of a  percent cut in  financing   the decision if not amended could have a  devastating impact on both the television companies and the  ministry of communications which broadcasts the television  signals and depends heavily on state television for its own  revenues  russian television general director anatoliy lysenko  predicted that the funding cuts could force transmitter shutdowns  and lead to the loss of the broadcasting network on a large  territory of russia komsomolskaya pravda  january  it is  not clear if the ministrys decision to slash funding is a first  step in a policy of reducing state ownership as yakovlev and  others have advocated or if state television simply served as a  convenient target of opportunity in the finance ministrys  struggle to control the money supply   end box       poltoranin routed      aspects of the reorganization strongly suggest that poltoranin  once the most influential figure in the yeltsin administration in  shaping media policy has suffered a startling defeat at the hands  of his rival for influence shumeyko  according to yuriy baturin  yeltsins security adviser and a codrafter of the existing law  on the mass media yeltsin shumeyko and prime minister viktor  chernomyrdin jointly agreed to the terms of the  december edict  on improving state management in the mass information sphere  izvestiya  december   that edict provided for separate  commissions to liquidate the press ministry and the fic but  appointed shumeyko to head both  poltoranin also appears to have  lost a battle over the edict granting ntv access to channel  a  move which he reportedly opposed  despite his removal as fic  head poltoranin will continue to be involved in media policy  possibly even in opposition to yeltsinas head of the committee  on information policy and communications in the state duma itar  tass rossiyskiye vesti  january  but for the first time  since before yeltsin was elected president see note   poltoranin will not have the authority to directly influence the  administrations media policy or to advise the president in an  official capacity  note  with the exception of a brief hiatus from  november   when he stepped down as minister of the press and  information to  december  when he was appointed head of the  newly created federal information center  poltoranin was  appointed minister of the press and information  july  by  the rsfsr supreme soviet      yakovlevs vision for television      yeltsins appointment of the father of glasnost and former  close gorbachev adviser aleksandr yakovlev to head the new  broadcasting service sends ambiguous signals about his intentions  regarding the broadcast media  yakovlev once served as the head  of the cpsu central committees propaganda department and yet has  been credited as the architect of the glasnost strategy to  liberalize the soviet media  although he has a reputation as a  reformer he does not appear to advocate westernization of russia  or unrestricted freedom for the media  in an izvestiya interview   december following his appointment yakovlev stated that he  would refrain from influencing subject matter but rather play a  strategic role as ostankino chairman  at the same time  however he expressed hope that the company will be able to  fulfill its role in society without succumbing to extremes and  on another occasion he spoke of increasing the share of russian  programs as a counterweight to foreign productions and  criticized excessive sex and violencegenerally attributed to  foreign influenceon television rria  february  he has also  apparently agreed recently to introduce a new weekly program on  ostankino in which head of the presidential administration sergey  filatov will explain presidential edicts mayak radio   january     yakovlevs appointment may signal future reductions in the  states role in television  he has asserted that there must be  one state television company which would operate without paid  advertising instead of the four companies see note  that exist  now ria  february  this goal appears to go handinhand with  the recent decision of the finance ministry to cut funding see  box  and may indeed become the ultimate solution to the states  difficulty financing state television at current levels  realization of yakovlevs goal of having one noncommercial state  television company could also provide a financial shot in the arm  to nonstate television since it would become the only vehicle  for television advertising  note  the four are ostankino rtv channel  and the st  petersburg channel      yakovlevs deputy      valentin lazutkin a longtime television professional who appears  to share yakovlevs views on reducing the states role in  television has been appointed as yakovlevs deputy  with  yakovlev taking a strategic approach to his chairmanship  lazutkin who has spent nearly  years in television and served  as first deputy chairman at ostankino until his recent promotion  will presumably run daytoday operations at ostankino  asked in  a recent interview published in izvestiya  january about his  opinion on the recent change in leadership he expressed the  hope that we need not fear that ostankinos airspace will be  turned into the political property of a particular party which  happened under the former chairman  he also noted that he was  untroubled by the recent decision to grant the private  production company ntv access to the fourth channel discussed  below though he did criticize the fact that access to the  channel was not granted on a competitive basis  and finally  discussing his concept of the future of staterun television  lazutkin said there should be one powerful russian company which  is    part of the state structure and he advocated  transforming ostankino into a company aimed at foreign audiences  including russianspeaking viewers in the cis      ntv gains broadcast access      in what may be the first step towards realizing yakovlevs vision  of decreasing the number of state television companies yeltsin  granted television broadcasting rights on channel  to an  independent company ntv  the  december edict on using moscow  televisions eighth frequency channel and its dissemination  network states that ntv will receive  hours of weekly  broadcast time as an experiment aimed at developing nonstate  television  ntv has been broadcasting a nightly news program  segodnya and a weekly newsmagazine ritogi to viewers of the st  petersburg channel which has a potential audience of about   million viewers and will continue to do so  the significance of  the edict for ntv does not appear to be that it increases  potential audience size since the two channels have significant  audience overlap but that it secures a measure of independence  from st petersburg television     most importantly the ntv edict affirms yeltsins support for the  idea of independent television following an apparent tugofwar  within the administration  yeltsin first issued the edict on   november but suspended it the next day itartass  november    november   on  december yeltsin reissued the  edict in almost identical form except that the new version tasked  the government with reviewing the issue of state participation  in the ranks of the founders making this text even more  privatizationoriented than the original      control of tv infrastructure      in the reorganization yeltsin reaffirmed that the state will  retain its monopoly of the broadcast infrastructure at least for  the present  the edict of  december on setting up the efir  russian state television and radio engineering center holding  company and the golos rossii russian state radio broadcasting  company created the efir holding company whose assets include  much of the states broadcasting infrastructure  efir will be  partially privatized with employees receiving some shares but  the edict stipulates that the state will retain ownership of a  controlling interest for three years  the edict does not  specify however what the state will do with its controlling  interest after three years  the edict appointed lazutkin to  serve as chairman of efirs board of directors  baturin  criticized the creation of efir and the reorganization in  general which he claims increases the states control over the  mass media and even to a certain extent threatens freedom of  the press rizvestiya  december   noting that all  central television channels are broadcast through efir baturin  asserted that independent television companies will remain non  state only in formal terms      control over rtv      the reorganization also serves notice that the other major  national television company rtv will remain under yeltsins and  yakovlevs control  control of the company had been a prolonged  point of contention between the president and the former supreme  soviet  in a demonstration of his authority over rtv yeltsin  reappointed the current chairman and general director oleg  poptsov and anatoliy lysenko by the edict of  december  formerly

chairman of  the new committee on the press  according to a profile of  mironov from obshchaya gazeta mironov had previously worked for  komsomolskaya pravda and with poltoranin when the latter served  at pravda  mironov reportedly also served for several days as  chief editor of rossiyskaya gazeta but was removed prior to or  shortly after publication of the papers inaugural issue in  november

deputy chairman  ruslan khasbulatov      new media watchdog created      yeltsins establishment of the court of appeals for information  disputes under the president appears to be an attempt to preempt  the new parliament from interfering in media policy as did its  predecessor rossiyskaya gazeta  january  the court is a  successor to the information arbitration court that was created  during the recent parliamentary election campaign to ensure fair  media coverage with largely the same membership including  chairman anatoliy vengerov  during the campaign vengerov and  the court demonstrated a degree of independence from yeltsin by  ruling that campaigning against the draft constitution was  permissible explicitly opposing yeltsins stated position that  sought to prohibit such campaigning itartass  december   izvestiya  november   the courts powers include the  authority to resolve disputes over the distribution of airtime  among parliamentary factions  it is also charged with ensuring  objectivity and authenticity in news reporting and the  principle of pluralism in radio and television programming and  may issue warnings regarding potential violations of the media  law a power it inherited from the defunct ministry of the press  and information  despite the courts record of independent  action the edict makes it dependent on the president stipulating  that it is not part of the system of russian federation federal  courts and the new bodys statute gives the president the power  to appoint and fire its members rossiyskaya gazeta  february      prospects      yeltsin has crafted a reorganization of russian media structures  that seems simultaneously to open the door to relinquishing  direct control over increasing amounts of broadcast airtime while  maintaining presidential control over the main facilities of  state television and the process of media oversight  the new  parliament may challenge yeltsin for control of at least some  mediathere is already talk among deputies of reasserting  control over rossiyskaya gazeta which the dissolved supreme  soviet controlled nezavisimaya gazeta  january  yeltsin is  likely to strongly resist such attempts and may invoke his  enhanced constitutional authority to do so  he may also  calculate that more westernstyle media independence is the best  way of ensuring that the media keeps supporting reform and stays  out of his opponents grasp  at the same time economic reality  as manifest by the recent oneday widespread broadcast blackout  and the finance ministrys decision to cut television funding by   percent will likely encourage him to move towards granting  more and more air time to independent television companies as he  has done with ntv and channel   author  crimmins

threatening statement echoed his declaration on   september that arafats fate will be no better than that of  french general petain during world war ii damascus radio     damascus radio reporting on a mammoth popular demonstration  in the palestinian camp alyarmuk organized by the hardline  factions quoted islamic jihad movement secretary general fathi  alshaqaqi as calling the massacre a continuation of the  liquidation plot embodied in the gazajericho accord   february      antiisrael vitriol      syrian media have also reverted to the kind of virulent anti  israel rhetoric that was a staple of syrian commentary in the  past but had been used with less regularity at least since the  start of the current peace process in october   thus  commentaries in the wake of the massacre have very frequently  favored the term zionists and tel aviv rulers over israel  and the israeli government  claiming that the hebron bloodbath  was simply the most recent of a long series of israeli massacres  alleged to have included the  february church bombing in  lebanon for example damascus radio  februarythe  commentaries have declared bluntly that the killings are  consistent with the nature of zionism and demonstrate the  impossibility of arabisraeli coexistence  several  commentaries in the daily tishrin as reported in sameday  broadcasts by damascus radio followed in this vein     on  february an editorial claimed that the hebron massacre  proves the impossibility of coexistence between arabs and  israelis resulting from the fascist zionist rancor against the  arabs     an editorial the following day declared that through the  recent massacre zionism is addressing a message that it has not  changed    its racist and aggressive colors     an editorial on the  claimed that zionism and racism   thrive on rivers of blood and referred to israel as this racist  nazi zionist ghoul      commitment to peace process but       nevertheless damascus has taken pains to emphasize commitment to  the peace process while using the media to question the utility  of resuming the nowsuspended talks in the absence of significant  concessions by israela tack it has taken during previous  disruptions in the negotiations  the damascus radio announcement  of the suspension of bilateral peace talks in washington by  syria lebanon and jordan was quick to cite a syrian spokesman  as having confirmed statements by us officials that this step  does not mean an end to the whole peace process that began two  years ago  february     two subsequent media commentaries that referred to the suspension  of talks also took pains to convey that the suspension is  temporary and to stress that syria remains committed to the peace  process  damascus radio affirming that the arabs are advocates  of true peace declared that the suspension of talks will not  harm the peace talks especially since only a few days are left  before the conclusion of the current session  march  and the  daily albath on the same day followed up mention of the  suspension of talks by adding that the arabs are not terminating  the peace efforts but are in effect telling the sponsors of the  peace process to wake up to their responsibilities damascus  radio     at the same time some editorial commentary has cast doubt on the  usefulness of negotiations under current conditions and called on  washington to play a more vigorous role in pressing israel for  concessions see note   for example damascus radio declared  that talking about peace in light of the serious zionist  escalation and israels continued refusal to withdraw from the  occupied territories or halt settlement activities is a waste of  time adding that it is indeed absurd  the commentary  concluded that there is no purpose or meaning in holding any  peace talks that are not based on a clear israeli commitment to  implement the un security council resolutions and withdraw from  the occupied arab territories  february  as reported by the  radio a subsequent editorial in althawrah asserted that  salvaging the peace process and the stalled peace talks requires  the application of all sorts of pressures on israel to make it  honor the relevant international legitimacy resolutions and  conventions respect human rights dismantle settlements disarm  settlers and return to the arabs all their territories and  rights  march     note  such expressions of doubt and even the conditioning of  resuming the talks on israeli concessions have appeared  periodically in syrian media commentary since the beginning of  the peace process  for example an editorial in tishrin last  november declared that any resumption of the peace talkswhich  had not then convened since before the signing of the dopmust  be preceded by a clear and public israeli commitment to the peace  process and its principles especially full withdrawal from the  arab territories damascus radio  november   several  weeks later however damascus announced its intention to return  to the peace talks without any public commitment from israel on  the issue of withdrawal damascus radio  december       implications      although damascus is probably hoping that the attack will scuttle  the dop syrian medias antiplo attacks and shrill hostile  rhetoric on israel will likely subside though not disappear if  peace negotiations are brought back on track  moreover in  raising claims that coexistence is impossible syrian media took  care to rule out coexistence not between israel and the arab  states but between israelis and arabs presumably in the  occupied territories  by such behavior syria has ensured that  the door remains open to the eventual resumption of the peace  talks  author brown  questions andor comments

    meat importers ec middlemen flood market with spoiled meat      centrist opposition daily alwafd criticized egyptian meat  importers and distributors labeling them the mafia and ec meat  distributors for deals that are resulting in the saturation of local  markets with sizeable quantities of overpriced frozen meat  available from european storage facilities that has expired or is  near its expiration date thereby exposing egyptian consumers to a  range of health hazards  the newspapers twopart investigative  report on this subject published on  and  january included  comments from egyptian health officials and meat industry  representatives  according to alwafd this spoiled meat is said  to frequently exceed international standards fdr fat content and is  available at extremely low cost to local importers and  consequently the meat is sold at from le  to le  whereas the  import cost is only le   due to the profit margin available from  sales to egypt european distributors and egyptian middlemen are  reportedly mounting a campaign against the egyptian government to  pressure the egyptian government into raising the fat content of  imported meat from  percent to  percent in other words for  every  kgs of meat the fat content is  kgs  alwafd  continues this pressure by distributors extends even to ec  officials to the point that one official has threatened to halt  meat shipments to egypt  in an effort to circumvent government  controls importers reportedly further conceal the fat content of  foreign meat imports by selling the meat piecemeal thereby  invalidating import certificates      egyptian health experts interviewed by alwafd expressed concern  about the illnesses that can result from the consumption of such  meats ranging from heart disease to salmonella  they said that the  availability of this meat will have a direct impact on the publics  health of particular concern is the plethora of factories producing  inexpensive luncheon meats primarily from frozen imported meat  health officials pointed not only to the spoilage of this meat but  also to the carcinogenic additives used by local companies to retard  it  further compounding this problem is the storage issue egypts  biggest problem is an inadequate number of refrigeration units to  store meat and retard bacterial growth in butcher shops and meat  suppliers facilities      industry experts also maintained that factories and shops must  comply with existing standards and specifications however they  acknowledged that the first step is to guarantee the quality of  imported meat  while egypt reportedly has procedures in place to  guarantee the quality of imports upon arrival elimination of the  meat mafia requires enforcement of existing food lats  al                                                            wafd has asked the ministers of health and industry to confront the  demands of the distributors and wondered whether

apparent effort to reassure foreign  investors and avoid actions that could jeopardize the european  communitys support for beijings gatt application prc media  have portrayed senior chinese leaders

future was authoritatively conveyed by a  spokesman of the hong kong and macao affairs office of the state  council on  february and reaffirmed by a foreign ministry  spokesman the same day  the chinese were reacting to the passage  by legco on  february of the first stage of pattens political  reforms and pattens announcement the same day that he would  formally submit the remainder of his reforms to legco on  march  and would publish a white paper on the contents of the  rounds  of talks with the prc in  on hong kongs political future  hong kong asia television  february  asserting that beijing  would make good on its previous threats to terminate negotiations  and dismantle political institutions established without chinese  consent if legco adopted pattens proposals the foreign ministry  spokesman declared that the door of the negotiations has been  closed by the british side and the framework of the  political system established by legco cannot last beyond june     responsibility for the disruption of cooperation  between china and britain on this issue he said rests  entirely with the british xinhua  february     signaling beijings determination to accelerate plans to  establish its own institutions to govern hong kong after the  takeover premier li peng declared on  february during a  session with members of the preliminary work committee pwca  group established last summer under the national peoples  congress to prepare for the hong kong transitionthat the pwcs  burdens and responsibilities have become even heavier and  greater and called upon the members to work harder and make  even greater contributions to hong kongs longstanding stability  and prosperity xinhua  similarly lu ping director of the  state council hong kong and macao affairs office warned that the  british were trying to mislead hong kong people by spreading  the view that the hong kong government based on pattens reforms  will not be terminated after  july  and called for  speeding up the working pace of the pwc zhongguo xinwen she   february     countering the white paper     in an apparent effort to bolster its political support in hong  kong the prc also mounted a media campaign to discredit the  british white papers version of the  talks first attacking  its credibility and pattens motives then issuing its own  version of the talks on  february xinhua  zhang junsheng  deputy director of xinhuas hong kong branch said in a   february interview that britains unilateral move to publicize  its version of the negotiations was intended to deceive hong  kong people and mislead public opinion xinhua  on   february a chinese foreign ministry spokesman commenting on a  lengthy foreign ministry version of what he claimed were the  facts concerning the talks asserted that pattens decision to  publish the white paper was designed to shirk its  responsibility for the rupture of the talks xinhua   february  in the text of the document publicized by xinhua  that day beijing reiterated its position that the core of the  controversy was not about whether democracy should be promoted  as claimed by the british but whether international commitments  should be honored     economic reprisals played down     despite the current political deadlock between the chinese and  british over hong kongs political future beijing has at least  for now backed away from its recent threats of economic  reprisals against british firms and signaled its interest in  longterm british investment  for example backing away from  minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation moftec wu  yis  january warning that the british governments  uncooperative attitude on hong kong is likely to affect sino  british trade ties xinhua  january prc vice president  rong yiren was depicted by xinhua on  february as cautiously  optimistic about the prospects for british investment  opportunities in china  in a meeting that day with the chairman  of the prominent british multinational company john swire and  sons rong reiterated beijings contention that britains  uncooperative approach was to blame for the current  difficulties on the hong kong issue but he went on to emphasize  that both china and the british firm were confident about the  economic prospects of hong kong and china and to observe that  swire had been enlarging its business in the region  xinhua  portrayed the british chairman as willing for his company to  engage in longterm investment in hong kong and the chinese  mainland     further suggesting a return to a more conciliatory approach on  economic relations top chinese officials have assured foreign  investors and the hong kong business community that its  uncompromising attitude on political reforms in hong kong will  not adversely affect economic ties  for example vice premier  zhu rongji reaffirmed chinas commitment to the territorys  capitalist system after the takeover during a  february press  conference in tokyo when he reiterated that china will not  change the system in hong kong after  xinhua  february  he went on to reassure the business community that the chinese  government will continue to protect the interests of foreign  funded firms in hong kong     beijings efforts to play down prospects of retaliation against  british firms may be linked in part to chinas desire for  continued european community ec support for its membership in  gatt  prc media used the recent visit to beijing of ec trade  commissioner leon brittan to provide an upbeat assessment of ec  backing for chinas application to gatt  xinhua of  february  reported that brittan at a joint news conference with moftec  minister wu yi that day announced that it would be economically  beneficial for china and the whole world to have china in  gatt  suggesting beijings efforts to avoid any overt threats of  economic reprisals prc media were not observed to carry western  media accounts that ec commissioner brittanin a response to wu  yis assertion during the press conference that the political row  with britain could affect economic tieswarned sharply that  retaliation against british firms would be completely  unacceptable to europe london daily telegraph  march     implications     beijings refusal to compromise on pattens political reforms and  determination to proceed with the establishment of a shadow  government in preparation for restructuring hong kongs  legislative institutions after  reflects both beijings drive  to ensure total political control over hong kong after the  takeover and the acute sensitivity of chinas ageing leaders to  perceived threats to chinas sovereignty including political  pressure on senior leader deng xiaoping who has staked his  reputation on reclaiming hong kong from its colonial past  at  the same time chinas decision to return to a more conciliatory  approach on economic relations likely reflects efforts to avoid  jeopardizing ec support for its gatt membership and may signal a  leadership view that given the failure of economic reprisals to  deter legco from passing democratic reforms and patten from  submitting his remaining proposals for a vote hong kongs  stability is best served by maintaining strong ties to the  british business community     author simon questions andor comments please call chief  china analysis team    eagbietzpf

countries  for its part beijing concerned about the  unsettled russian political situation appeared reluctant to  embrace kozyrevs initiative suggesting instead a more modest  expansion of bilateral ties                                 end summary      visiting china from  to  january kozyrevthe first high  ranking russian visitor to beijing since the middecember  elections in russianot only reaffirmed moscows intention to  maintain its relationship with beijing but also called for  significantly expanding those ties and creating what he called a  constructive partnership between the two countries  introducing this initiative at a press conference on  january  kozyrev said a constructive partnership between the two  countries would mean a qualitatively higherlevel of bilateral  ties itartass  january  expanding on this theme in a  speech the following day to chinas peoples institute of  diplomacy the russian foreign minister portrayed the new  relationship as a multifaceted one itartass  january  beijing and moscow he indicated should cooperate in solving the  new problems in asia focusing on the danger from the  proliferation of nuclear weapons and missile technologies the  question of access to the resources of the pacific ocean and the  problems caused by an upswing of religious nationalism in  afghanistan and tajikistan  kozyrev went on to underscore the  importance of cooperation in these areas saying that the failure  to make joint efforts to resolve these problems would result in  a very explosive situation  in addition to cooperation on  regional problems kozyrev suggested that his constructive  partnership would lead to greater sinorussian cooperation in the  international arena particularly in the un security council on  problems such as peacekeeping operations in tajikistan and  nuclear weapons on the korean peninsula     economic relations and highlevel visits      kozyrev also pressed his chinese hosts to raise the level of  economic relations between the two countries saying in a press  conference on  january that the constructive partnership  presupposes a transition to a higher level and more stable  forms of economic cooperation itartass  january  in  particular he pointed to the need to change the form of cross  border contacts from petty commercial dealings to large joint  projects  elaborating on the economic aspect of his  constructive partnership kozyrev in remarks aired by moscows  mayak radio on  january said that russia would count on  chinese support in getting russia included in plans for  regional economic cooperation  in addition he noted that russia  was very interested in participating in modernizing those  chinese industrial enterprises which were originally set up by  moscow and was ready to participate in major economic  development projects like the three gorges hydroelectric project      finally kozyrev suggested that his constructive partnership  proposal demands increasing the number of highlevel contacts  between moscow and beijing  at his  january press conference  he claimed that this aspect of his initiative had already been  accepted saying that his visit had mapped out a program of  exchanges which would be capped by a visit to moscow by prc  president and chinese communist party general secretary jiang  zemin      moscows positive assessment      moscow was upbeat in assessing the results of kozyrevs visit  commenting on kozyrevs  january meeting with prc foreign  minister qian qichen for example galina sidorova kozyrevs  political adviser claimed that the two ministers had agreed to  continue a progressive and constant exchange of views and visits  at summit and highlevels itartass  january  she noted  that jiang zemin would visit moscow in the third quarter and  that his visit would be preceded by trips to beijing by russian  premier viktor chernomyrdin and to moscow by foreign minister  qian  she noted that the two sides had indicated their  readiness to continue negotiating their border problems and had  decided to maintain the status quo on the border after it had  been demarcated  she also claimed that the two foreign ministers  had expressed their mutual interest in further developing  constructive cooperation in the militarytechnical sphere      a  january itartass report on the visit was even more positive  in assessing the results of the kozyrevqian talks  it said that  the foreign ministers had confirmed their mutual desire for the  development of political trade economic and military  cooperation and pointed to the need to raise the level of sino  russian relations  according to itartass on the  kozyrev  was also upbeat in assessing the results of the visit in remarks  while made on route to moscow  he claimed that with the visit  china and russia had established new relations characterized by  normal cooperation and that the relationship now contained  elements of geostrategic mutual understanding  he also  portrayed beijing as receptive to his proposal for a constructive  partnership claiming that chinese leaders had been very  balanced and positive in principle in their response to his  initiative      cautious chinese reaction      reflecting chinas longstanding wariness about dealings with  moscow as well as its concern about the unpredictable political  situation in russia beijing was considerably more circumspect in  its treatment of kozyrevs visit and his suggestion that the two  countries rapidly expand their relationship  reflecting  beijings desire for a slower pace of development of bilateral  relations qian according to a  january xinhua account  of his meeting with kozyrev that day underscored the importance  of maintaining and developing longterm good neighborly  friendly mutually beneficial and cooperative relations between  the two countries but did not repeat kozyrevs optimistic  predictions of a rapid expansion of ties  while qian in  response to kozyrevs call for summit meeting between the  leaders of the two countries this year said that china  attaches importance to maintaining dialogue and contacts  between the leaders of the two countries he seemed to dismiss  the idea pointedly noting that documents signed during russian  president boris yeltsins  visit to china as still being  carried out step by step      judging by xinhua accounts of their  january meetings with  kozyrev li peng and jiang zemin also counselled a more moderate  approach to developing bilateral ties  january  li for  example was reported by xinhua as telling kozyrev that the  correct policies agreed to during yeltsins  visit should  be adhered to for a long period   turning to economic matters  he suggested that the two sides need to proceed from reality  and explore new ways of bilateral cooperation  jiang similarly  seemed to advocate a more cautious approach telling kozyrev that  bilateral relations are developing steadily and noting that  chinas firm and unwavering policy is to maintain and develop  longterm and steady good neighborly and friendly relations with  russia      like qian jiang also expressed reservations about kozyrevs  proposal for a summit meeting this year  according to xinhua  jiang in response to yeltsins invitation to visit russia  merely expressed the hope that the visit can be materialized  at an appropriate time  however the xinhua report on li pengs  meeting with kozyrev did indicate that beijing would accept a  visit to beijing by chernomyrdin noting that li invited the  russian premier to visit china      further underscoring beijings more circumspect approach to the  relationship chinese media reporting on the visit gave short  shrift to kozyrevs proposal for a constructive partnership  failing to report his  january speech to the peoples institute  of diplomacy outlining the initiative  in addition xinhua  accounts of kozyrevs meetings with qian on  january and with  jiang zemin the following day did not indicate that kozyrev had  presented his proposal to them during the talks   january  while the  january xinhua report on kozyrevs meeting with li  said that the russian foreign minister had stated that in todays  turbulent world the constructive partnership between the two  sides should be enhanced and reach new heights it did not  indicate that li made any response to kozyrevs initiative      prospects      despite chinese concerns about the russian political situation  beijing and moscow are likely to continue expanding their  relationship  however beijing anxious to avoid any  entanglements or fallout from the unsettled political situation  in russia will remain cautious as it proceeds in developing  those ties  beijing will continue respond positively to moscows  desire for greater economic cooperation  in addition the  inclusion of deputy defense minister general boris gromov as a  member of kozyrevs delegation suggests that military cooperation  will remain a key

        dprk reiterates stance against preconditions for us talks        summary                                  pyongyang has made a point of reminding washington that linking  the resumption of bilateral highlevel talks to the exchange of  special envoys by north and south korea could jeopardize ongoing  international nuclear inspections  the north continues to signal  its reluctance to engage the south in any substantive dialogue  beyond the bare minimum required for the convening of the dprk  us talks                            end summary      to draw attention to pyongyangs stance vice foreign minister  kang sokchu head of the north korean delegation to last  summers highlevel talks with the united states took the  unusual step of issuing his own press statementsee note on   march  kangs statement claimed that there were no preconditions  stipulated in the  february dprkus agreement for resumption  of bilateral talks  the statement carried in full by kcna and  pyongyang radio the same day also complained that washington is  using the exchange of envoys and iaea inspections as  preconditions for suspension of team spirit and the convening of  highlevel north koreaus talks set for  march in geneva      note a press statement is typically issued in the name of a  foreign ministry spokesman  this is only the second time kang  has been observed to issue a press statement of his own  kang  issued a press statement last november calling for a package  solution to resolve the deadlocked nuclear issue trends of   november  pages  step that eventually led to the   february agreement      focusing on the special envoys issue kang claimed in his  march  statement that the  february agreement only mentioned  resumption of workinglevel contacts to discuss the topic and not  realization of the exchanges  his statement also implied that  any us insistence that the envoy exchange precede resumption of  highlevel talks could jeopardize iaea inspections  reiterating  pyongyangs depiction of seoul as irrelevant to discussions of  the nuclear issue kang contended that the south has neither  political wherewithal nor authority to discuss the nuclear  issue  implying that the north will agree to exchange envoys on  nonnuclear issues only kang claimed that only when the south  stops the unjustifiable act of trying to push its way into the  discussion of the nuclear issue and makes a clear switch toward  seeking national unification can the exchange of special envoys  take place  kang said that reintroducing unjustifiable  preconditionsconditions that he claimed the united states had  tried but failed to include in the  february agreementcan  been seen only as an element capable of destroying the full  implementation of the agreement      in a  march followup commentary the party paper nodong sinmun  similarly cautioned washington against creating artificial  difficulties by setting preconditions  the commentary urged a  strict observance of unspecified principles set forth in last  junes dprkus joint statement kcna  march      interkorean dialogue     in line with pyongyangs posture north  korean media have characterized the fourth interkorean  workinglevel meeting on the exchange of presidential envoys  held on  march as having made no progress  the north korean  chief delegate introduced two new demands pyongyang tv  march  in addition to the previously raised issues of  stopping all  nuclear exercises and  renouncing the international  cooperative system pyongyang tv  october  is  seeking cooperation with the united states and japan to apply  pressure on pyongyang on the nuclear issue with attendant  references to unimposed sanctions  the two new conditions are  that seoul       call off its effort to bring in patriot missiles       withdraw remarks that it will not shake hands with the  north an oblique reference to the remarks south korean president  kim yongsam made last june      also suggesting that the north korean leadership is not quite  ready to engage the south in serious discussions pyongyang media  have continued their harsh personal attacks on rok president kim  the latest attack came in a  march kcna dispatch criticizing the  remarks made by kim to seoul radio which according to kcna  showed that kim is a heinous traitor and a dyedinthewool  flunkeyist  the only sign so far that pyongyang does not want  to totally foreclose the avenue of dialogue for now is the fact  that the north korean chief delegate at the  march meeting  refrained from directly naming president kim in his remarks at  the talks as reported by north korean media      background     the idea of exchanging presidential special envoys  was first advanced by the north last may to deal with all  issues related to national unification most likely as a fall  back position on the eve of the first round dprkus nuclear  talks then slated for  june  subsequently after much  wrangling three preliminary meetings were held to discuss  procedural matters and agenda  however on the eve of a fourth  workinglevel contact scheduled for  november the north called  off the meeting to protest remarks by the south korean defense  minister who pyongyang claimed had hinted at the possibility  of a preemptive strike against north korean nuclear facilities  yonhap  november   moreover even while reluctantly  agreeing to the latest round of interkorean contacts pyongyang  has still maintained that the nuclear issue must be resolved  bilaterally between the dprk and the united states      implications     although couched in tough language kangs  warning against preconditions did not rule out the possibility  that envoys may be exchanged before  march  in fact  pyongyangs stance may be designed to test washingtons resolve  to stand behind seoul as the latter navigates the waters of  interkorean dialogue  therefore while pyongyangs hardened  stance at the northsouth talks may represent posturing for  bargaining its continued personal attacks on rok president kim  suggests that the north is still reluctant to reach any agreement  of substance with the south at present and is proceeding with  interkorean talks solely to meet requirements for the resumption  of highlevel dprkus talks     author  yim  questionscomments please call chief asia  division analysis team

                                 russian president boris yeltsin is carrying out yet another  reorganization of his presidential apparatus this time clearly  to help him expand presidential power visavis parliament and  the cabinet  the new constitution pushed through by yeltsin  after disbanding the supreme soviet gives the president more  control over the cabinet and the rest of government and the  current reorganization is being justified by the need to expand  his staff to exercise these expanded powers  the strengthening  of the presidents apparatus and especially his analytical and  policy making staff is important for the prospects for reform  since with a unsympathetic parliament and a less reformist  cabinet reform policies more than ever depend on a strong  president                           end summary      since december yeltsin has been creating new agencies directly  subordinate to the president adding new assistants expanding  the security council structure and now is preparing an edict to  reorganize and strengthen his administration the presidential  staff  although he has apparently not yet signed the edict the  reasons for the reorganization and its main features are being  widely reported in the press  administration leaders have  claimed that the main reason for the reorganization is that  because of the presidents increased powers under the new  constitution he requires a bigger staff to help him initiate  policies and run more of the government  administration leader  sergey filatov told itartass on  february that the additional  presidential powers in the new constitution necessitate  reorganization of the administration and that a new economic  analysis service finance and budget directorate and  international department are being created to help the president  stay well informed on the economy budget and tax policy  nikolay medvedev head of the administrations directorate for  work with territories and presidential representatives also  stated that the administration was to be reorganized to bring it  into line with the new constitution segodnya  january      reports of an impending reorganization of the administration  began to appear in early january kuranty  january georgiy  satarov to itartass on  january segodnya  january nikolay  medvedev to segodnya  january  filatov told itartass on   january that yeltsin would probably sign a decree reorganizing  the administration the next week  over three weeks later the  decree had not appeared but he again told itartass on   february that yeltsin would sign the decree in a few days  on   february he told interfax that yeltsin had the proposals for the  reorganization on his desk      split between filatov and ilyushin      the delay was apparently caused by disagreements over two rival  plans presented by the two main groups in yeltsins personal  staffthe administration led by filatov and yeltsins assistants  and advisers led by first assistant to the president viktor  ilyushin  segodnya reported on  january that filatov favored a  plan worked out by his first deputy sergey krasavchenko which  concentrated analysis in a single center in the administration  while ilyushin backed a plan worked out by members of the  presidential council to expand the role of presidential  assistants giving them their own analytical staffs outside the  administration  moscow news  february also reported that  filatov and ilyushin were pushing rival plans and said that  yeltsin had not yet chosen which to accept  kommersantdaily on   february reported that a compromise plan had been worked out  making ilyushin for the first time officially equal in status  to filatov and strengthening the group of personal assistants  but accepting most of filatovs proposals regarding the  administrations structure see box on reorganization of  administration  news reports of the disagreements apparently  prompted filatov and ilyushin to appear together on the  television news program itogi on  february to deny that there  had been disagreements and to declare that they have a joint  agreed on version of the administration reorganization which  divides functions between the administration and assistants  this compromise arrangement would appear to heighten the  potential for conflict between the already competing parallel  structures of the administration and staff of assistants by  making them even more independent rival power bases      other recent changes      yeltsins effort to strengthen presidential structures has been  evident since december in the addition of more personal  assistants to his staff his assumption of control over more key  government agencies the creation of new organs under the  president and the strengthening of the security councils  commission structure      new assistants      yeltsin has added two new reformminded assistants pomoshchniki  to his present four who were less involved in policy at least  publicly      he created a new post of national security assistant and named  outspoken reformer yuriy baturin to it on  january ostankino  tv itartass  january  baturin explained to interfax   january that he would coordinate the activities of the  intelligence counterintelligence and other security services  he had joined yeltsins staff as an assistant on

february rossiyskaya gazeta  february and he explained in  a  february ostankino tv interview that he will handle  presidential ties with the federal assembly and parties and  public organizations and constitutional questions  he has  occasionally riled yeltsin with his public remarks see note   and told rossiyskiye vesti  february that he feels yeltsin  wants him to continue to speak out independently and offer  differing opinions      note   in october while yeltsin was visiting japan satarov  suggested presidential elections be held simultaneous with  parliamentary elections undercutting yeltsins stand and  prompting yeltsin to publicly threaten to fire him obshchaya  gazeta  october       control over power ministries      yeltsin has assumed more control over some key cabinet ministries  and other government agencies clearly strengthening his power  over the most sensitive security and communications agencies to  protect himself against potential challenges  his  january  edict on the structure of federal organs of executive power  listed  agencies which henceforth will be subordinate to the  president of the russian federation on questions put under him by  the russian federation constitution or in accord with legislative  acts of the russian federation  the ministries of defense  internal affairs and foreign affairs the main directorate for  protection the foreign intelligence service the federal agency  for government communications and information the federal border  service the federal counterintelligence service the federal  service for television and radio broadcasting and the state  archive service rossiyskaya gazeta  january      new presidential organs      in recent weeks yeltsin has created a number of new organs  directly under the president expanding the already cumbersome  structure run directly by the president  in some cases it is not  clear if they add to his political power but for some reason the  president considered it necessary to put them under his direct  control rather than under the cabinet or elsewhere in the  government  in addition to creating the federal  counterintelligence service and the federal border service  specifically under the president in mid and late december      on  december yeltsin issued an edict creating a judicial  chamber for information disputes sudebnaya palata po  informatsionnym sporam under the president rossiyskaya gazeta   january which apparently can be used to strengthen the  presidents control over the media  according to itartass it  will be able to decide matters such as allotment of radio and  television coverage to the parliament and can warn media if they  violate the law on the mass media  chairman anatoliy vengerov  said that the chamber will enforce constitutional provisions on  information rights and assist the president in protecting freedom  of the press itartass  january  the new constitution  guarantees the freedom of mass

security council second only to the cabinet as a  highlevel executive body has become more active with new  commissions being formed under it and those created earlier being  activated  although a  february yeltsin edict itartass   february dropped economic officials the ministers of the  economy and finance in listing the new membership of the  security councilappearing to remove economic questions from its  purviewthe expansion of the councils working commissions  including one on economic security appears to broaden its  activities rather than reduce them  a  march kommersantdaily  article argued that the role of the security council may increase  substantially since it is the best organ for yeltsin to use to  govern given the independence of the cabinet under premier  viktor chernomyrdin and the lack of a reformist majority in the  duma      an interdepartmental commission on information security was  created by a yeltsin decree on  december  the new commission  held its first meeting on  january and began working on its  main taskworking out state policy for information security  itartass  january      the councils interdepartmental commission for defense security

created the council with a  november decree rossiyskaya gazeta   february      implications      with a hostile parliament and a cabinet led by an apparently  loyal but less reformist premier chernomyrdin yeltsin appears to  be building up presidential structures that aided by stronger  presidential powers in the new constitution will enable him to  press reform policies on his own  his expanding group of  specialists analysts and policyoriented assistants may enable  him to develop more effective policies and establish better  control over the government more effectively competing with an  assertive duma or cabinet  he has however reorganized his  presidential structures before for example bringing filatov in  to strengthen his administration in early  and his staffs  effectiveness still appears to leave something to be desired  moreover by perpetuating parallel structuresthe administration  led by filatov and the staff of assistants under ilyushinthe  new reorganization preserves great potential for competition and  conflict within the presidential apparatus      box                   reorganization of the administration      although yeltsin has apparently not yet signed an edict  reorganizing the whole administration the features of such a  reorganization have been described in accounts and charts  published in segodnya on  february and kommersantdaily and  novaya yezhednevnaya gazeta on  february and several edicts  reorganizing parts of the administration have already appeared  abolishing the directorate for information resources in early  february creating a financebudget directorate on  february  and creating a directorate for information supply on  march  according to these accounts the new structure of the  administration aims to      improve analysis by combining the present three analytical  centers and a newly created situation room situationnaya  komnata into one analytical service analiticheskaya sluzhba  which will probably employ on a fulltime basis many of the  present parttime presidential analysts kommersantdaily   february  according to the  january segodnya the poor  performance of the present analytical centers during the december  electionin analyzing voters attitudes predicting the outcome  and analyzing the resultswas one of the reasons for the filatov  and ilyushin reorganization

affairs and threatening to resign  his post as minister of nationality affairs and regional policy  sergey shakhray appears to have halted and even reversed his  political decline following the december elections  after losing  deputy premier status in the recent cabinet reorganization  shakhray appears to have rebounded by means of a presidential  decree giving him special status as a member of the government  presidium  although the decree appears to mark at least  shakhrays partial return to president boris yeltsins good  graces he continues to split with the president on major issues  such as the recent amnesty for yeltsins opponents suggesting  the apparent reconciliation may be shortlived                           end summary     a presidential decree dated  february

his acceptance of the  ministerial port folio on  january  after being offered the  portfolio shakhray reportedly said that he would accept only if  the nationality affairs and regional policy ministry were made  directly subordinate to the premier and he as minister were  included in the presidium interfax  january     note   shakhray was previously chairman of the russian  federation state committee for nationality affairs and regional  policy which was changed into a ministry in the postelection  cabinet reshuffle  see the trends of  january  pages    for a summary of changes to the cabinet     note   on  february itartass reported that economics  minister aleksandr shokhinalso a leader of shakhrays party of  russian unity and accord presis a member of the presidium     shakhray had held the nationalities portfolio and the rank of  deputy premier until chernomyrdin reorganized the cabinet  reducing the number of deputy premiers and redistributing their  responsibilities  the reshuffle decreased the number of deputy  premiers from six to four and the remaining deputy premiers were  given more responsibilities  mayak radio  january itartass   february  following the reorganization chernomyrdin signed  a decision tasking first deputy premier oleg soskovets with the  coordination of the activities of  ministries state  committees and departments itartass  february  chernomyrdins reshuffle also assigned each of the deputy  premiers oversight over specific areas of social and economic  policy but did not explicitly assign the nationalities portfolio  to any of them suggesting that shakhray will have considerable  latitude in this area     end of eclipse     recent media commentary on shakhrays situation interpreted the  decree as a victory for him ending a period in which his  influence on nationality affairs was visibly declining  following his demotion from deputy premier to minister in the  cabinet reshuffle itartass  january an article in the   january issue of moskovskiy komsomolets reported that nationality  affairs were being handled by other officials leaving shakhray  out of the loop on important developments     deputy premiers yuriy yarov and aleksandr zaveryukha had been  given joint jurisdiction over nationality affairs and shakhray  was now complaining that he was being used as a front instead  of being the man in charge of regional policy     chernomyrdin had met with chechen republic deputy premier  mairbek mugadayev in disregard of shakhrays directive not to  treat representatives of the chechen government as leaders of an  independent republic     shakhray had complained thhat government officials invited him  to study tatarstans draft treaty on the mutual delegation of  authority and terms of reference only after he expressed in an  interfax interview his bewilderment at not being included in the  treaty negotiations     other media reports also noted that shakhray appeared to be  losing influence  according to interfax  january well  informed sources within the government had said that shakhray  had been virtually debarred from handling regional issues  kommersantdaily reported that before he was elevated to the  presidium shakhray had been complaining to journalists that  urgent problems such as tatarstan and chechnya were being handled  without his involvement  shakhray was also apparently excluded  from a  january telephone conference with the heads of  administration of a number of regions discussing preparations  for upcoming local elections  according to rossiyskaya gazeta   january presidential administration leader sergey filatov  led the conference and yarov participated     background to eclipse     shakhray appeared to overcome what the moskovskiy komsomolets  article called his rather dubious status by threatening to  refuse to accept reappointment to the nationalities portfolio  interfax  january quoted shakhray as saying that if vital  issues of regional and nationality policies continue to be dealt  with without participation of the government member responsible  for these issues     i will not be able to work in the  cabinet     shakhrays eclipse from nationality issues and his loss of the  deputy premier post were probably retaliation by yeltsin for  shakhrays limited support of the president and his reform team  at crucial moments before and during the december election  campaign  yeltsin disdained shakhrays establishment of the  party of russian unity and accord pres for splitting his reform  team and contributing to the reformers december national  election defeat by splitting the vote  although yeltsin avoided  direct association with any party during the national election  he had been perceived as favoring russias choice in spirit  mayak radio  october  as many of his close  associates formed the party and actively promoted his reforms  during the october  crisis shakhray pushed for compromise  and simultaneous presidential and parliamentary elections rather  than fully supporting yeltsins decisions  shakhray had also  undermined yeltsins authority at a preparatory regional  conference by openly disagreeing with yeltsins decision to urge  the voluntary dissolution of local soviets interfax  october       outlook     shakhrays special status as a member of the presidium puts him  on a par in effect with the deputy premiers and probably allows  him as he had demanded to report directly to chernomyrdin on  nationality affairs  the arrangement may also facilitate the  division of labor among the deputy premiers allowing the cabinet  to make fuller use of shakhrays experience in nationality  affairs and freeing the others to concentrate on priority  economic issues  with shakhray apparently positioning himself as  a future presidential candidate and staking out positions opposed  to yeltsin on key political issuesmost recently on the issue of  amnesty for yeltsin

discussing shariah rules on contemporary insurance  systems including commercial cooperative life and social  insurance  he noted that several islamic conferences on insurance  were held and that they all ended with recommendations but no  decisions      certifying islamic interpreters      dr sabri abdalrauf professor of jurisprudence at alazhar  university was interviewed explaining the qualifications needed  for someone to interpret the teachings of islam  he pointed out  that individual interpretation of islam by qualified and highly  educated people will remain open as long as there is life to prove  to the world that the islamic shariah is suitable for all times and  places and is consistent with the time in which we live      death for apostates dictated in islam      writer hasan mahmud khalil speaking on the issues of death  sentences for apostates hadd alriddah and religious freedom  argued with those who claim that there is nothing called a death  sentence on apostates because there is no verse in the koran that  calls for punishing a muslim apostate on earth and that this  contradicts religious freedom  he noted that while it is not  mentioned in the koran it is mentioned in the sunnah prophetic  sayings and the sunnah he said is the second source of  legislation and islam after the koran  he added that sunnah  contains various religious legal rulings  there was a sunnah that  confirmed what is contained in the koran and another that explained  the koran  he further explained that islam protects rights and  freedoms and the first of these freedoms is the freedom of belief  and expression  no one is forced to abandon or change his religion  a person can choose which religion to believe and accept but if he  adopts islam willingly he accepts its rules and submits to its  obligations  he will be asked about every shortcoming  khalil  also said that the punishment for apostasy was legalized to  safeguard religion ensure its course deter those who wish to enter  islam to achieve certain purposes and then return to their  infidelity and purge society of such hypocrites and exploiters of  religion  he concluded that apostates are more dangerous to islam  than nonmuslims because they distort religion and deceive many  people who are not familiar with islam      shaykh abdalrahman defended      writer muntasir alzayyat argued in an article entitled umar  abdalrahman the other side that dr abdalrahman is being  held in the united states on political rather than legal grounds  he said that the indictment issued by the federal court in new york  in the case of the world trade center explosion on  september did  not include the name of dr umar abdalrahman although much  media clamor was raised at the time  this alzayyat said opens  the way for his possible release soon      alzayyat then recalled that the us administration several  months ago wanted dr abdalrahman to leave the country saying  that his entry into the united states was improper  describing this  as ridiculous and surprising he said that if shaykh umars  entry visa which he received in khartoum was wrong then why did  no one find fault with his previous  and  entries to the  united states  he further argued that the us administration  wanted to get dr umar abdalrahman out and could not explicitly  express that therefore it said that he violated immigration laws  and began looking for a country to take him  the problem became  more complicated alzayyat said when the egyptian government asked  for his extradition and the prime minister of afghanistan agreed to  receive him  this was unacceptable to the us administration he  said adding that the day when abdalrahmans lawyer officially  requested that the shaykh be allowed to leave for kabul he was  officially charged to prevent him from traveling there  therefore  the problem is not governed by legal considerations but political  if dr abdalrahman was treated according to law he would always  emerge victorious      the writer then tried to shed more light on the critical and  fabricated problem of dr abdalrahman  he said the man has  always paid for his daring beliefs and views  his freedom has been  restricted since the death of former president jamal abdalnasir  when he called from the pulpit that no prayers should be made for  president abdalnasir      alzayyat then reviewed dr abdalrahmans struggle for his  beliefs in egypt since that time noting that he was subjected to  ugly torture during his imprisonment from  to  and was  insulted and defamed by all the media the writer added that when  he left prison he was strong and continued to adhere to his beliefs  and call for the application of the shariah  he was threatened by  former interior ministers zaki badr and abdalhalim musa and as a  result left egypt and has not since returned      in further defense of dr abdalrahman the writer said in  the case of dr abdalrahman the law worked in his favor  however the law now is not respected in egypt by those who make it  the problem is being tackled on a political basis and the political  situation today is hostile to shaykh umar and all those who follow  in his footsteps      alzayyat continued  the proceedings for the trial of dr umar  abdalrahman are being resumed in alfayyum at a time when such  measures were suspended in new york  it is dr umar abdal  rahmans fate to pay the price for his adherence to his beliefs and  his islamic call      islamic subversives beware      dr sad alhilwani history lecturer at the alazhar  universitys arabic language college warned of attempts by  subversive elements to undermine the muslim religion  he also  warned against moral and religious degeneration as a result of  immoral

employment subsidies  summary  battered by japans prolonged  economic slump numerous firms in three auto industry sectors  finished car makers autobody manufacturers and auto parts  makersare temporarily shutting down operations and initiating  onetime layoffs according to media reports  an increasing  number of large industry firms are joining smaller companies in  receiving government employment adjustment subsidies to offset  labor costs associated with the layoffs      according to the  january nihon keizai shimbun nikkei japans  auto industry is reeling from the fall in domestic demand for  new cars because of the prolonged recession  on  january the  japan automobile dealers association announced that domestic auto  sales in  fell for the third straight year to a sixyear low  sales of cars excluding minicars trucks and buses totaled   vehicles down  percent from  and the lowest level  since   the paper adds that sales have fallen nearly  percent  from their peak in       auto exports also have fallen sharply  according to the japan  automobile manufacturers association in january  auto exports  fell by  percent compared to january  to  vehicles  the tenth consecutive monthly decline the  february nikkei  reports  this is the largest drop since statistics have been  collected and the lowest number of vehicles exported in the month  of january since   further the monthly value of both auto and  auto parts exports fell  percent to just over  billion the  fifth consecutive monthly decline the paper notes      companies forced to initiate temporary layoffs  according to the   november  asahi shimbun because of the prolonged slump the  auto industry is faced with excess personnel and production  capacity  however given japans lifetime employment system  companies are unable to simply fire workers and are looking for  other means to lower labor costs  one means companies have resorted  to according to asahi is onetime or temporary layoffs  under  this arrangement to reduce production without actually firing  excess personnel firms require that designated workers take  temporary layoffs during which plant operations are halted  firms  must pay an operations shutdown allowance equal to or more than   percent of the employees average salary as required by the labor  standards law      to help firms in selected industries during recessionary  downturns in  the japanese government initiated an employment  adjustment subsidy system through which the ministry of labor mol  pays companies a subsidy to offset labor costs during temporary  layoffs retraining and employee transfers asahi notes  to  receive these subsidies firms must first be designated as being  in an industry sector experiencing difficulties by the mol after  which the firm must specify the conditions of its temporary layoffs  and petition the mol for the subsidies  this designation is  effective for  year after which the industry may be redesignated  by the mol for another year      large number of industry firms receiving employment subsidies   in the auto industry the autobody manufacturing sector received  mol certification for employment adjustment subsidies in late  january  according to the  february  nikkei following an  appeal by the japan autobody industries association which  represents  firms  the mol eligibility designation was set to  expire on  january  but according to the  february   nikkei sangyo shimbun the mol redesignated the autobody sector  for another year  on  may  the finished auto assembly sector  and the auto parts manufacturing sector were also added to mols  list of industries eligible for employment adjustment subsidies  according to the  may  nikkei weekly      since the designations were made the number of companies  utilizing onetime layoffs has been increasing reports the   february  nikkei sangyo  according to mol statistics the  number of finished car makers including some autobody assembly  firms who petitioned for labor adjustment subsidies to pay for  temporary shutdowns and layoffs mushroomed in late  from five  firms in november to  in december covering  employees  as  these firms halted production in a ripple effect an increasing  number of autobody and auto parts firms have had to initiate work  stoppages nikkei sangyo reports  the number of autobody firms  undertaking work stoppages in november expanded to  and then to   firms while the number of targeted personnel increased from  to        auto parts firms particularly hard hit  auto parts manufacturing  firms have been particularly hard hit by the downturn according to  the  january nikkei sangyo  the number of parts companies  planning work stoppages more than doubled from  firms in october  to  in november while the number of employees involved jumped  from  in october to  in november  further according to  the  february nikkei sangyo the numbers increased again from  november to december from  to  firms  nikii  adds                                                     that the finished car and auto parts industries do not expect the  number of firms requesting subsidies to fall any time soon  press reports on companies initiating layoffs requesting  subsidies  although a number of small auto industry firms applied  for subsides soon after the mol made its designations until october   no major company had applied  subsequently a number of larger  autorelated firms plans to initiate temporary layoffs and apply for  employment adjustment subsidies  according to press reports the  following companies have initiated temporary layoffs and have  received employment adjustment subsidies      nissan motor coaccording the  october mainichi shimbun  nissan announced plans to apply for subsidies after revealing that  it would stop production for two days in november on one line at its  tochigi assembly plant which employs  people and institute  temporary layoffs on those days to  production workers  in  november nissan announced it would expand the scope of temporary  layoffs to include virtually all domestic production lines  the   november mainichi shimbun reports that nissan decided to target  nearly  employees and five plants for twoday shutdowns in  december which would cut production by nearly  vehicles      in december nissan announced it would continue to conduct  temporary layoffs and production shutdowns in january and february  according to the  december yomiuri shimbun  in january nissan  had shutdowns for three days at its murayama and yokohama plants  two days at its tochigi plant and one day at its kyushu plant  in  february the company planned layoffs for two days at its tochigi and  kyushu plants and one day at the murayama plant  according to  yomiuri the murayama plant will have been closed six days during  four consecutive months of temporary shutdowns      mazda motor corpaccording to the  october mainichi mazda  decided to initiate temporary layoffs of two days in november for   of its nearly  employees throughout the country  mainichi reports that mazda also applied for employment adjustment  subsidies  the  december  shimbun reports that mazda  following its november layoffs planned to have four days of layoffs  in january at its hofu plant  mazda which is heavily dependent on  exports has seen its sales fall for fourteen consecutive months      nissan diesel motoraccording to the  november  nikkei  nissan diesel a heavyduty truck and bus manufacturer announced it  would initiate two days of temporary layoffs

oneday shutdowns in february  and march affecting more than  employees  the firm plans to  apply for employment adjustment subsidies from the mol  the  shutdowns will cover all of the companys offices and eight plants  in japan  it has seen orders for wire harnesses which account for  over  percent of total sales plummet nearly  percent since    if orders do not recover soon the firm may extend its  planned shutdowns beyond march      tsuchiya manufacturing coaccording to the  january   nikkei sangyo tsuchiya an auto parts maker affiliated with nissan  plans to stop production for two days a month at its main plant in  kawasaki city  during this time the salary of fulltime employees  will be covered by employment adjustment subsidies but the salaries  of temporary and parttime employees will be reduced on a prorated  basis  the kawasaki plant which among other things produces fuel  oil and air filters accounts for nearly onethird the firms total  sales  the work stoppages will continue until demand for auto  parts has recovered according to company officials  further the  company is considering work stoppages at other plants where  productivity is low      other suppliers receiving subsidies under different designations   other major suppliers to the auto industry have resorted to  temporary layoffs and have accepted employment adjustment subsidies  under other industry designations  two major examples from the  rubber and steel industry are as follows      bridgestone corpthe  december  nikkei reports that  bridgestone the worlds second largest tire manufacturer announced  that it would initiate three and four days of temporary layoffs at  the end of december at nine of the its ten tire plants in japan  the firm will also apply for subsidies  layoffs could cover   employees or nearly  percent of the firms total payroll      according to nikkei the tire industry received its mol  designation at the end of november and this is the first time  temporary layoffs have taken place in the tire industry  earlier  bridges tone decreased the number of operating days from seven to  five per week but even this measure failed to compensate for the  severe drop in demand for tires      daido steel cothe worlds largest maker of specialty steel and  a major supplier to the auto industry particularly to nissan daido  announced it would receive

undertaken temporary layoffs at its  kawasaki plant this is its first largescale employment  adjustment  daidos sales have fallen for three consecutive years      economic trends  feature  keidanren role likely to change under  new chairman  summary  on  february the federation of economic  organizations keidanren selected shoichiro toyoda chairman of  toyota motor corp to succeed gaishi hiraiwa as keidanren chairman  according to press reports  while toyoda chairs japans largest  manufacturing firm some industrial leaders express concern whether  he can successfully lead japanese industry because of his  personality and toyotas unusual corporate culture  the press  anticipates that under toyodas leadership keidanren will become an  ordinary economic organization representing the interests of  private business rather than acting as a coordinator between  politicians bureaucrats and the business community      on  february keidanren chose shoichiro toyoda  years old  chairman of toyota motor corp and a keidanren vice president to  succeed gaishi hiraiwa when he steps down as keidanren chairman in  may according to the  february nikkei sangyo shimbun  the  company name is rendered toyota the legal family name is  toyoda  while industrial leaders generally welcomed toyodas  selection they also expressed concern based on his background as  the owner and chairman of toyota motor according to the  february  mainichi shimbun  the  february nikkei sangyo quotes an  unidentified industrial leader as questioning toyodas ability to  break free from toyota egoism and lead japanese industry from a  broader viewpoint  writing in the  february nikkei sangyo  editorial staff writer atsushi suemura asks whether the head of  toyota which is often said to have a mikawa the old name for  aichi prefecture monroe doctrinewe dont interfere with you so  dont you interfere with usis qualified to lead the entirety of  japanese industries      the  february nihon keizai shimbun nikkei reports on the  expectationswhich also reflect the concerns industrial leaders  have concerning toyoda  masaru hayami chairman of japans  association of corporate executives keizai doyukai states that he  wants toyoda to exhibit strong leadership apart from the interests  of the auto industry  kosaku inaba chairman of the japan chamber  of commerce and industry says that the key lies in how well toyoda  can balance the interests of various industries and the interests  of consumers and corporate shareholders not as the manager of  toyota motor which has always defended the interests of toyota and  the auto industry but as a leader of all industries      concerning japanus trade issues yoshinari yamashiro chairman  of steel firm nkk corp notes that japanus friction is the  japanus automobile problem according to the  february nikkei  implying that toyota motor should change its corporate philosophy  and behavior to ease japanus trade friction  the article adds  that toyota motor symbolizes japans large trade surplus      where will keidanren go under toyodas leadership  writing in  the  january asahi economic reporter yomei tsuji speculates that  keidanren may become an ordinary economic organization under  toyodas leadership  tsuji assumes that keidanren will abandon its  function of channelling corporate political contributions to the  political parties  since toyota motor has devoted itself to  manufacturing and selling cars from its aichi prefecture base and  has avoided involvement in politics in tokyo tsuji expects toyoda  to be effective in changing keidanrens relationship with  politicians      in addition unlike previous keidanren chairmen who came from the  steel heavy machinery or electric power industries industry  sectors which were sponsored by the government toyoda is a  representative of true private sector firms in japan  a change in  keidanrens chairmanship from a leader of statesponsored industry  to a private industry leader tsuji maintains means that japans  economy has been taken from the governments hands  he also notes  that since toyoda comes from the auto industry which must sell to  consumers directly keidanren under toyoda is expected to pay more  attention to consumer interests unlike his predecessors who spoke  about national interests as leaders of japan inc      writing in the  february nikkei editorial staff writer kazuo  mori notes that toyodas keidanren will no longer play the role of  coordinating interests between industry the politicians and  bureaucrats  indeed now it will be difficult for keidanren to  coordinate interests even within private industry  mori notes that  toyota is an ownermanaged firm which tends to compete fiercely  and to pursue only its own interests even though it has become a  giant  he observes that the keidanrens selection of toyoda  indicates that competition based on market principles will be  emphasized by corporations more than ever  japanese practices that  hinder competition mori notes such as implementing policies  through discussions among political bureaucratic and industrial  circles will be avoided      press urges toyodas keidanren to promote deregulation  on  and   february nikkei sankei shimbun asahi mainichi and yomiuri  carried editorials on toyodas selection  all the editorials urge  keidanren under toyodas leadership to promote deregulation  for  example asahi points out that japans auto industry has grown to  the level of the us auto industry because of selfinitiated  technical innovations and rationalization efforts not by support  from the government and urges toyoda to boldly promote  deregulation  mainichi noting that toyoda himself was a member of  the hiraiwa study group urges him to take the initiative in  pressing the government to implement the hiraiwa report and further  promote deregulation  yomiuri also asks toyoda to promote  deregulation to change japans economic structure under which  corporations compete for market share or conduct business in a  collusive manner      sankeis editorial notes that keidanren also must change its role  of being a coordinator between government and industry to being a  representative of private companies  through channelling corporate  contributions to the liberal democratic party ldp the past   years keidanren has directly and indirectly influenced government  policy formulation but it now has to deal directly with  government regulators    the editorial urges the keidanren under  toyoda not be passive toward the government concerning regulations  and administrative guidance but rather assert its opinions and act  as the leader of private firms in protecting private sector  vitality      profiles note similarities between toyoda hosokawa  the   january chunichi shimbun points out the many similarities between  toyoda and prime minister morihiro hosokawa such as being from a  wellknown family from a regional city and somewhat amateurs in  their respective new fields but also observing that the era  requires such leaders  toyoda is from a rich familythe eldest  grandson of toyota founder sakichi toyodaand has reached his  current position without any political or financial support from  the outside  he is viewed as an honest and sincere person the  paper notes but not a tactician or a charismatic leader  since  he has been far removed from tokyo toyoda reputedly has not been  involved in politics and is not close to a political party or  politicians  he is also viewed as an amateur industrial leader  because he had not been involved in the activities of any economic  organization before becoming a keidanren vice chairman in   toyoda has a doctorate in mechanical engineering and is an  accomplished engineer      according to the  february chunichi toyodas stances on various  issues are as follows   political contributions  toyoda thinks politicians should receive  government support and individual contributions rather than  contributions from business  he realizes this will disconnect  collusion within in the socalled iron triangle of politicians  bureaucrats and corporations   japanus trade  toyoda believes that japan and the united  states should build a trade relationship based on harmony and  competition  he has opposed setting numerical targets for japans  imports of automobiles and auto parts   economic structural reform  he believes that corporations should  promote selfhelp efforts to restructure themselves as their own  responsibility while the government should make the japanese market  more open and fair by deregulation      feature  welfare payment increases will offset tax cuts for  households  summary  japans proposed increases in welfare and  national annuity premium rates will lessen the stimulative effects  of the governments proposed income tax cuts on the consumption of  working households according to press reports  the total increase  in premium payments is estimated to be equivalent to onefourth the  total estimated gain in disposable income from the income tax cuts  thus largely offsetting tax cuts for averageincome working  households  the ministry of health and welfare mhw claims on the  other hand that retirees will receive annuity increases that  slightly exceed the total amount of premium increases      the mhw has drafted a bill to reform the welfare annuity program  for private sector wage earners and the national annuity program  for the selfemployed students and people without jobs which  includes premium rate increases in  according to the   february nihon keizai shimbun nikkei the draft bill will be  submitted to the diet in midmarch for deliberation  according to  the mhw draft the welfare annuity premium rate will increase from  the current  percent split equally between employer and  employee to  percent of monthly salaries effective in october   increasing to  percent effective october  and a new  payment of  percent split between employer and employee of each  bonus payment effective in april   regarding the national  annuity premium the current premium amount which is a fixed   yen  will be raised to  yen  per month effective  april       the  february nikkei reports that total welfare and national  annuity premium payments by working households will increase by   trillion yen  billion a year which is nearly equivalent to  onefourth the estimated  trillion yen  billion in income  tax cuts specified in the  february economic stimulus package  according to mhws calculations cited by nikkei the total amount of  welfare annuity premiums will increase by approximately  trillion  yen  billion a year assuming an average workers monthly  salary of  yen  and  million wage earners  of this   trillion yen  billion  trillion yen  billion  will be paid by wage earners since employers and employees equally  split premium payments  the mhw also anticipates that total  national annuity premiums will increase by  billion yen   million a year      premium hikes will wipe out tax cut gains for averageincome  families  according to the  february nikkei working households  with annual incomes below  million yen  will realize  little benefit from the income tax cuts due to increases in annuity  premium payments and other public levies  moreover while the  income tax cuts are only for  the premium increases will be  permanent  in the case of a household with an annual income of   million yen  or below an income tax cut of around   yen  or less will be largely offset by the increased welfare  annuity premium payments  although the mhw claims that welfare  annuity recipients over  years of age will receive  percent more  in benefits from  and therefore the total household disposable  income will increase by  trillion yen  billion nikkei  argues that incomes will increase at the cost of increased burdens  for all working households      more broadly the nikkei article notes that  may be a losing  year for working class households with children in school since  postal rates have recently increased a  increase in  national university tuition has been proposed for  and an  increase in tokyo expressway tolls has been proposed  the paper  concludes that even when workers want to have a bottle of beer after  a hard days work a  yen  tax increase per bottle will  hurt their thin wallets      feature  economic organizations critical of miti interference   summary  the ministry of international trade and industry miti  reportedly faxed a memorandum to four major private economic  organizations summarizing the important points of the latest  government economic stimulus package as well as model comments to  be made by the heads of the four organizations before the hosokawa  cabinet approved the package on  february according to press  reports  a  keizai shimbun article on  february reported  that the economic organizations were very critical of mitis  interference concerning comments by their leaders  an editorial  in that newspaper the same day sharply criticizes miti for  excessive guidance of the private sector observing that it is  quite ironic that under the hosokawa administration which  advocates deregulation the bureaucrats control of the private  sector appears to have been strengthened      major economic organizations are very critical of mitis  interference concerning comments by their leaders on government  economic policies according to the  february nihon keizai shimbun  nikkei  miti reportedly faxed a memorandum summarizing the  important points of the latest government economic stimulus  package and model comments to the offices of four leading private  sector economic organizationsthe federation of economic  organizations keidanren the japanese association of corporate  executives keizai doyukai the japan federation of employers  association nikkeiren and the japan chamber of commerce and  industryon the afternoon of  february a few hours before the  hosokawa cabinet approved the stimulus package  the fax reportedly  emphasized the importance of praising measures like the income  tax cut and supporting the governments policy of cutting direct  taxes and increasing indirect taxes  according to the nikkei  article the model comments for use by the heads of the four  economic organizations included  we highly praise the courageous  decisions of the government and coalition to include an income tax  cut in the stimulus package      although miti defended its action with the assertion that it  never intended to force the organizations to use mitis comments  nikkei reports that the economic organizations are annoyed by the  fax which sounded like an order for them to use mitis comments  the article notes that this is the first instance of miti actually  sending a document instructing the economic organizations what to  say although in the past miti telephoned them to request that they  make comments favorable to miti      according to a source connected with an economic organization  cited by nikkei bureaucratic interference concerning comments by  leaders of the economic organizations assumed prominence in  december  when jiro saito ministry of finance vice minister  and hideaki kumano miti vice minister visited the four  organizations to explain the governments policy of income tax  cuts to be paid for by increases in the consumption tax      editorial blasts fax as example of mitis excessive guidance   nikkeis  february editorial which is headlined appalled by  mitis excessive guidance is very critical of miti noting that  its fax reminds us of an education mama teaching a twoyearold  with simple words  however it observes the postwar period in  which japanese industries were rebuilt under strong miti guidance  has already ended  mitis excessive guidance the editorial  continues is an extreme anachronism  miti may think that it can  freely control private economic organizations with its guidance but  such presumptuousness is no longer acceptable  the editorial urges  miti to realize that excessive guidance is now one of the causes  hindering the vitality of japanese industries      the editorial also points out that mitis fax may be cited by  the us government to prove its assertion that bureaucrats  control the japanese economy  it notes that during the recent  japanus framework talks the us government criticized japanese  bureaucrats for controlling the japanese economy and

governor stock exchange  head  mitsuhide yamaguchi president of the exportimport bank of  japan exim bank who entered the ministry of finance mof in   and rose to  become vice minister in  is rumored to be the  probable candidate to succeed bank of japan boj governor yasushi  mieno in december  when mienos term ends  in recent years the  boj governorship has alternated between former mof vice ministers  and boj careerists  since mieno is a boj careerist the next  governor is likely to be a former mof vice minister  although  appointing the boj governor is the prerogative of the prime  minister the incumbent mof vice minister customarily recommends a  candidate to the prime minister who almost automatically  approves      although yamaguchi is rumored to be the probable candidate the  mof boj and banking industry officials are not completely sure  yet  they question whether the hosokawa administration will last  until december when mieno steps down and if prime minister  morihiro hosokawas advocacy of reforms might lead to changes in  the selection process  there have been several instances in the  past where the personal desires of prime ministers altered the  selection process  one example was prime minister masayoshi ohiras  selection of haruo maekawa then vice president of the exim bank  over mof candidate satoshi sumita president of the exim bank at  that time  as a result sumita had to wait for five years before  getting his chance      boj officials have been resistant to the custom whereby every  second boj governor is a former mof vice minister  a senior boj  official is quoted as saying that the boj governor needs to have a  sustainable and mediumterm viewpoint of the economy and be strong  enough to implement monetary policies from such a viewpoint  regardless of what the public at large may say implying that  being a former mof vice minister in itself is not a sufficient  qualification to be boj governor  some banking industry officials  are also concerned that former mof bureaucrats tend to compromise  too easily with politicians  they are also concerned that former  mof officials tend to adhere to mofnot bojpriorities and  subject monetary policy to the mofs fiscal objectives  yoshino rumored to be next tse board chairman  yoshihiko  yoshino president of the japan development bank who entered the  mof in  and became vice minister in  most likely will  succeed minoru nagaoka chairman of the tokyo stock exchange tse  board of directors when nagaoka steps down in may  the  chairmanship has been filled by former mop vice ministers since   when the tse invited former mof vice minister teiichiro  morinaga to restore financial health to the securities industry  following the socalled securities recession of the   since likely candidates from within the securities industry have  been tainted by the stockloss compensation scandals of  it is  highly likely that a former mof vice minister will become the next  tse chairman  nagaoka has been quoted as saying that since current  mof vice minister jiro saito plans and decides personnel moves of  all former mof bureaucrats saito will select a candidate from  among the available former mof vice ministers  then the candidate  will be nominated by the tse board of directors and officially  elected by twothirds of all tse members      within the securities industry however there is strong  resistance to the chairmanship becoming a reserved seat for former  mof vice ministers  the president of a major securities house  states that the securities industry is now capable of voluntarily  promoting fairness and transparency in the stock market so that  the industry no longer needs influential mof retirees  another  reason for the strong resistance is that the securities industry was  not happy with nagaoka who in the industrys view adopted the  mofs position rather than representing the securities industry  during the series of securities scandals that began in   this  viewpoint was particularly evident concerning the issue of  establishing a securities industry watchdog organization  nagaoka  supported the mofs idea of establishing the securities exchange  surveillance commission within the mof instead of an independent  organization similar to the us securities and exchange commission  which the industry sought  tokyo asahi shimbun  feb  p       mof to require disclosure of offbalance sheet transactions   the ministry of finance mof has decided to require financial  institutions to disclose information on the status of their so  called offbalance sheet transactions  the mof has determined  that the nontransparency of financial transactions not currently  included in a financial institutions balance sheetsocalled off  balance sheet transactions such as unlisted futures swaps and  optionsand the concomitant risk of such transactions can cause  enormous instability to the japanese financial system as a whole  consequently the mof will reconvene its special advisory panel in  march to study the issue in detail      offbalance sheet transactions use cuttingedge financial  engineering techniques to allow financial institutions to hedge  against risk  compared to more traditional financial instruments  such as loans offbalancesheet transactions are conducive to  largevolume trading across national borders and have a  destabilizing effect internationally when a contract default occurs  overseas offbalancesheet transactions of japanese financial  institutions are said to be ballooning which is one reason why the  bank for international settlements bis is calling for their  thorough disclosure and methods of managing the concomitant risks      some of the issues the mof advisory committee the working  subcommittee on financial institution disclosure will consider  are  whether it can establish a means for marketvalue assessment  of unlisted offbalancesheet financial products whether risk  assessment of all counterparts to offbalancesheet transactions and  comprehensive risk assessment are possible whether overseas  transactions are to be disclosed as well and whether

empirical data as well as statistical figures from the central  bureau of statistics  sumitros conclusion is that indonesias  economic development has been less efficient and less effective  compared with other asean countries whose economies are  structurally similar  the papers also note that sumitro  attributes this undesirable situation to the large amounts of  waste and losses caused by mismanagement investments in  infrastructure that have slow or little yield incompetence in  planning operating and maintaining investment projects and  irregularities such as graft      bisnis

million metric tons of rice which brought in revenues  that are second only to earnings from  crude oil export  the   january tuan bao quoc te points out that although vietnam currently  ranks third among world rice exporters rice dealers have registered  losses of about  million in october  in exporting more than   metric tons of rice      tuan bao quoc te tbqt suggests that one of the main reasons for  the losses in rice export earnings is the stiff competition between  rice dealers resulting in rising domestic purchase prices and  falling export prices  another reason cited by the newspaper is  poor management by the state  despite a government directive to  reduce the number of principal rice exporters to  there were  still over  exporters in november  since any firm with a  contract listing prices commensurate with government prices could  obtain an export permit including those who did not have storage  space or processing mills     tbqt also cites the shortage of funds used to buy rice as a  problem  some  million were actually required to purchase rice  in the mekong river delta but the largest amount received was only   and the smallest  while small enterprises received  only  percent of the funds needed  according to tbqt few firms  want to sign big contracts and take out loans to buy rice for export  ahead of time but they will rush out to make rice purchases only  when customers offer letters of credit and ships start to come in      tbqt reports that vietnamese rice export increased from   million metric tons in  to  million metric tons in  and  totaled  million metric tons in   the number of countries  who have signed purchase contracts with vietnam has also increased  from  in  to  in   the quality of the exported rice is  reportedly improving each year with an increasingly smaller  percentage of broken rice  currently prices for vietnamese rice  are  less per metric ton than thai rice of the same quality      tbqt concludes that to achieve success in rice export the state  needs to improve its management system strengthen the union of  grain exporters and give rice exporters regular guidance on  domestic and international trade regulations in order to avoid the  kind of losses experienced in the last quarter of       government to approve foreign construction of infrastructure  projects  the vietnamese government will

botstyle  system involves entrusting all matters concerning infrastructural  projects to foreign companies from financing to construction and  actual operation  the government has great expectations

many problems with the bot system  involving contracts let by government agencies and the companies  signing them as exemplified by the recent withdrawal of japanese  companies from an expressway construction project in thailand  in  vietnams case there probably will be difficulties over the long  term in collecting fees from completed generating plants highways  and bridges  and even if some

angrily to former us  president richard nixons meetings in moscow with opposition  leaders including former vice president aleksandr rutskoy who  had only recently been released from prison  despite his harsh  reaction he appeared to attempt to minimize the damage to us  russian relations  nevertheless his reaction and the initial  treatment of the incident by the russian media suggest that  moscow is concerned that the united states may be reevaluating  its policy toward his administration                             end summary     yeltsin angrily announced cancellation of his meeting

amnesty approved by the russian legislature over yeltsins  opposition and communist party leader gennadiy zyuganov  yeltsin stressed that neither he the government nor his chief  of staffall scheduled to meet with former president nixon  would now receive him  further highlighting his displeasure  yeltsin stressed that russia is a great country and simply  cannot be trifled with interfax itartass  march     yeltsin appeared concerned to limit the damage to relations with  the united states while at the same time giving an implicit  warning that bilateral relations could be harmed by such  incidents  he noted that he was impressed with the position  taken by us president bill clinton who he said had phoned him  and distanced himself from  nixons trip and  stressed that the usrussian partnership must be preserved and  developed as a great achievement that we worked very hard for  and we must not lose itartass  march     similarly the russian foreign ministry appeared to distance  itself and the us government from the former presidents visit  according to interfax the ministry said that it has nothing to  do with  nixons visit and the news agency  quoted a highranking russian diplomat as saying that the  ministry would have monitored the visit had the american  embassy been in charge of it  march     in contrast zyuganov and the russian communist partys press  service portrayed the meeting with former president nixon as a  deliberate effort by the us government to broaden its contacts  within russia  claiming that the expresidents meeting with  zyuganov will give us officials a more realistic picture of  what is happening in russia the press service announced that the  meeting proves that such a better understanding is what the  us leadership wants  zyuganov himself claimed that the  communists and all russian patriotic movements were concerned  over the inflexible us approach to russian political forces  and believed that the growth in antiamerican sentiment in  russia was connected with us unconditional support for the  present unpopular executive power interfax  march     media coverage     russian media coverage of the visit as presented on  march  after his meeting with rutskoy was negative  itartass citing  competent sources on the reasons behind the cancellation of the  government meetings said that the former presidents initiatives  had been seen as a sign of disrespect for the political will of  the russian leadership  one russian television commentary see  boxdescribing rutskoy as a recent lefortovo  inmate  linked former president nixons meetings with what it claimed  was recent us maneuvering on foreign policy toward russia and  wondered whats going on in american foreign policy and if  there was a change of politicial direction in washington  russian tv  march     implications     yeltsins angry response to what he portrayed as a personal and  political insult suggests a concern that the united states is  reevaluating its relationship with russia and with him  personally  yeltsins sharp reaction and the media coverage of  the incident so far is consistent with previous russian reaction  to what are seen as the us administrations efforts to review  its policy toward russia     box     staterun russian televisions coverage of former us president  richard nixons visit to moscow included what appears to be a  deliberate attempt to raise questions about us policy toward  russia and dramatize the yeltsin administrations decision to  cancel meetings with him     the coverage of the visit on the  gmt newscast on  march  began with a commentary on relations between russia and the  united states which claimed that recent visits to the us by  ukrainian president leonid kravchuk and georgian president eduard  shevardnadze had led to agreements with the us that were  revisions of agreements previously reached with russian  participation  the commentator g shakhov then turned to the  private visit by former president nixon noting that the latter  considered it necessary to meet the previous day with former  vicepresident aleksandr rutskoy and russian communist party  leader gennadiy zyuganov but only today intended to meet with  leading officials such as prime minister viktor chernomyrdin and  administration leader sergey filatov  shakov also noted the  former presidents intention to meet with liberal democratic  party leader vladimir zhirinovskiy and concluded his commentary  by asking rhetorically whether all this is a foreign policy  maneuver by the us or a change in political orientation     the news anchor then reported that richard nixon was expected  to meet with chernomyrdin and filatov and hoped to meet with  russian president boris yeltsin  the report was followed by  another commentary seemingly designed to embarrass both former  president nixon and us president bill clinton and to suggest  that former president nixon would be reporting to president  clinton on his russian visit  the commentor noted that when he  returned to the united states the former president would be able  to share not only his impressions from moscow but also his rich  experience in political scandals asserting that president  clinton had already suffered through some unpleasant moments  due to the whitewater scandal  the news anchor concluded the  programs coverage of the visit with an announcement that he had  just received a report from itartass that the planned  meetings with chernomyrdin and filatov would not take place  itartass was first observed

 in     the wake of the hebron massacre both prime minister yitzhaq  rabin and foreign minister shimon peres have hinted that the  israeli government is laying the groundwork for dismantling a few

divorced from the current negotiations with the plo  he  explained that the israeli government had insisted on deferring  the settlement issue to final status negotiations while  negotiating the dop

opposition forces as a  discriminatory youth minimum wage  according to delphine girard  writing in the  march la tribune desfosses balladur made these  concessions to calm the social tempest he created in approving a  law to implement the cip which originally would have allowed  employers to hire those under  years of ageeven those with a  junior college degreefor  percent of frances guaranteed minimum  wage smic and would have required that the company provide a  mentor to help the new employee to begin his career  balladur has  agreed to redefine the cip stating that mentors must provide real  training within the company  he has also replaced the provision  allowing junior college hirees to be paid at  percent of the smig  with the stipulation they must be paid instead at  percent of the  conventional minimum wage of the industry which cannot be below  the regular smic  those with no degree however may still be hired  at the belowminimumwage rate      balladurs concessions were made not only under pressure from  labor students and opposition groups but also from members of his  own governing coalition  an article in the  march la tribune  desfosses reported that former prime minister jacques chirac entered  the debate having declared a youth minimum wage is an illadapted  way to solve unemployment bringing with it important  inconveniences  an article in

the udf youth movement also made  public its objection to balladurs choice of fighting youth  unemployment asking him to review his options  the president of  the finance committee of the national assembly jacques barrot  contended that the text of the implementation law on cip is not  satisfactory and that the tutorial obligations of companies using  the cip must be better defined  he also said that more detailed  coordination on the strategies taken toward junior college graduates  is needed      despite balladur relenting to these pressures and subsequently  redefining the cip provisions the labor unions are not convinced he  has gone far enough girard continues in the  march la tribune  desfosses  the unions still refuse to support what they insist on  calling the youth

unions over the cip is not  regarded as such by employers according to an article in la tribune  desfosses  employers state that there either are jobs or there are  no jobs  employing more workers depends above all on business  activity and that this type of measure the cip can only serve to  plug holes where personnel are needed for six or eight months or  until the economy picks up  however the article claims employers  view the cip as rather positive noting that apprenticeship  contracts have worked well and that the idea of lowering the wage  cost is nothing new  the danger according to employers is that  the cip is becoming too politicized and is too associated with a  youth minimum wage  as for the fears that the young will take jobs  away from the more experienced the article cites statements from  staff members at the vallourec company as saying it is a false  problem since a company is always tempted to do just that  the cip  would change nothing  other employers pointed out that they prefer  a more longterm hiring policy and that in any case companies are  looking for workers with at least a junior college education rather  than those with no advanced education dii

bernd hof of the institute of the german  economy in cologne  according to hof japanese labor productivity  measured in terms of real gdp per worker declined by  percent in   compared with only a  percent drop for germany  in fact  hof found that the productivity gap between japanese and german  industry continues to widen  while the recessionrelated decline in  production has caused the profits of japanese companies to tumble  german firms appear to be recovering and making progress at least  in cutting costs  by reducing workforces and increasing  productivity the germans have been able to achieve lower unit wage  costs and higher profits  this development also has its darker  side however as evidenced by current unemployment figures and  fears that when the next economic upturn comes the skilled workers  currently unemployed either will no longer be available or will be  employable only at disproportionately high costs  the japanese  share these fears and are therefore hesitant to lay off permanent  staff      hof arguing that the real reason for the decline in japanese  productivity is its traditional reluctance to lay off workers sees  a remarkable parallel in the german automobile industry with one  essential difference as exemplified by volkswagen  although  volkswagen has reduced working hours for its employees by  percent  rather than lay them off it has benefitted from workers giving up   to  percent of their wages  consequently volkswagen is in a  better wagecost position than a japanese company where workers are  working fewer hours but drawing

missed longterm growth cycleaccording  to one economist germanys failure to abandon outmoded industries  in favor of the growth sectors of the information age has caused it  to miss a longterm economic growth cycle and condemned it to a  lengthy struggle with recession and high unemployment  leo nefiodow  of the institute for mathematics and data processing in sankt  augustin contends that germany has failed to recognize information  technology as the driving force of the latest in a series of   growth cycles  instead of encouraging the development of growth  industries in the information field nef iodow argues germany has  continued to subsidize the dying industries of the previous cycle  which was characterized by energyintensive industries like  automobiles and petrochemicals  consequently those who believe  renewed german prosperity will come with the next economic upturn  will have to wait a long time  in fact no upturn will come  unless the countrys economic structure adapts to these underlying  shifts in the world economy      in nefiodows view other countriesnotably japanhave done a  better job of riding the latest economic wave  he notes that only  one german firmsiemensnixdorfplays a significant role in the  information field while japan is represented by over  companies  nef iodow ascribes germanys failure to capitalize on the current  cycle primarily to social and cultural factors  germanys emphasis  on individualism and hierarchical forms of organization he  maintains makes it less able to respond to the demands of the  information age than japan with its stress on group wellbeing and  teamwork  while nefiodow believes it is too late for germany to  catch up he contends the country may be well positioned to  anticipate the next one which he thinks could be driven by the  information environmental and health industries since germany has  highquality measurement and process control and software and  systems

problem to an aging population longer life expectancy fewer  contributors and more annuitants  solbes suggested substituting  the current payment system for one which more closely resembles a  defined contribution plan rather than the current defined benefit  plan which guarantees pension benefits regardless of the amount  contributed  currently contributions are mandatory for  years      an

statements by the uous leaders show that it has  not abandoned its central ambition of playing a leading role in  shaping the armed forces and acting as the guardian of their  loyalty and honesty  its vigorous activity in the parliamentary  election campaign shows its determination to seek alternate means  to exert influence on the military even in the face of the  defense ministrys hostility  its strong and longstanding links  with rukh and other important political groups will probably be  helpful to it in this endeavor     appendix a  the uous agenda     uou spokesmen have said that the unions goal is to ensure that  all members of ukraines officer corps will be honest competent  and loyal to ukraine see for example the uou draft program in  narodnaya armiya  june  as well as interviews by thenuou  first deputy chairman vitaliy chechylo in narodnaya armiya   march  thenuou chairman oleksandr skypalskyy and kiev local  organization chairman volodymyr saladyak in narodna armiya   may  and current uou chairman oleksandr rol in samostiyna  ukrayina  february   stated in such general terms these  goals are hardly controversial and in fact have been endorsed  even by the uous opponents including radetskyy see his  articles in armiya ukrayiny  january  and in ukrayinska  hazeta  february   controversy has centered instead on  the uous aspiration to play a direct and leading role in  personnel decisions down to the level of influencing individual  appointments and dismissals as well as on its criteria  particularly ethnicityfor ensuring loyalty to ukraine     beyond its primary interest in influencing personnel and  indoctrination the uou has also pledged to work for better  living conditions for servicemen and to prevent the  misappropriation of military property either by corrupt  individuals or by russia  its focus on ukrainian nationalism is  displayed in its strenuous opposition to crimean separatism  it  has also lobbied against ceding control of the former soviet  black sea fleet to russia and against the presence of any foreign  troops in ukraine khreshchatyk  march      military personnel indoctrination and loyalty issues     the uous attempts to shape ukraines officer corps has been its  main raison detre almost from the beginning  two key uou  leaders hryhoriy omelchenko and volodymyr mulyava see appendix  c biographical information have played the most prominent roles  in this area  omelchenko has sought to use his positions in the  security service and on the defense ministry higher certification  commission to weed out unsuitable officersthough he claims to  have been thwarted in these efforts by entrenched conservatives  in government see above page    mulyava meanwhile took the  lead in attempting to mold servicemen into what he and the uou  considered ukrainian patriots  it remains unclear to what extent  this meantas critics chargedfavoring ethnic ukrainians over  ethnic russians see above page     however uou leaders  frequently warned union audiences against the danger of ethnic  discrimination suggesting that at least some uou supporters  despite denials may have in fact pursued discrimination against  russians  for instance uou deputy chairman andriy haysynskyy  told an interviewer in  that in my opinion ethnicity should  have no significance implying that others did not share that  view za vilnu ukrayinu  september   at the third uou  congress deputy chairman v lazorkin said the union should  help military personnel authorities make correct appointments  to key posts which should be filled only by true patriots  while lazorkins statement was not unambiguously a call for  ethnic discrimination it may have been understood as such  omelchenko who was elected uou chairman the next day responded  to lazorkin by warning against seeking enemies on the basis of  their ethnicity narodnaya armiya  april   the concern  with ethnicity seems to be lingering however even among the  uous friends an interviewer for the nationalist newspaper za  vilnu ukrayinu praised newlyelected uou chairman oleksandr rols  good idiomatic ukrainian as evidence of his healthy family  roots  january      whatever its views on ethnicity the uou clearly will not  willingly give up its claim to a role in shaping ukraines  officer corps  in a recent interview newlyelected chairman  oleksandr rol while making conciliatory statements about the new  defense ministry leadership asserted that we  consider  it our duty to indoctrinate army personnel in the spirit of  ukrainian patriotism and glorious traditions of the ukrainian  army samostiyna ukrayina  february      the uou has also pushed insistently to require all officers to  swear allegiance to the ukrainian state  characteristically the  union presented itself as the guarantor that this goal would be  achieved  it early on created a data bank to identify officers  who had or had not taken the oath moscow ostankino tv   january   thenuou chairman vilen martirosyan said he would  use this data to lobby for the dismissal of all commanders who  refused the oath moscow radio  march      the defense ministry has endorsed this goal but not a uou role  in enforcing it  in  thenmilitary personnel chief  oleksandr ihnatenko a uou ally said that all officers who  refused the oath would be transferred to service in russia or  other former soviet republics krasnaya zvezda  june   one officer major grigoriy nesmyanovich claimed that this in  practice meant denying salaries and other benefits to officers  who refused the oath as a way of pressuring them to leave ukraine  voluntarily rossiyskaya gazeta  july   defense minister  vitaliy radetskyy a uou opponent recently ordered that any  remaining officers who had not taken the oath be removed from  active service unian  february      yet another aspect of uou involvement in military personnel  matters has been its campaign to bring ukrainian servicemen  stationed in other parts of the former soviet union or in eastern  europe home to ukraine  shortly after the dissolution of the  soviet union the uou executive committee called for an  interstate agreement to send all former soviet servicemen to  their native republics narodnaya armiya  january   thendefense minister konstyantyn morozov told the third uou  congress that the return of these servicemen would help to  ukrainianize the army golos ukrainy  april      protection of military property     the uou has cast itself as the protector of military property  from both theft and attempts by russian authorities to  appropriate equipment claimed by ukraine  the subject was raised  at the second uou congress literaturna ukrayina  november   and at a january  uou executive committee session  narodnaya armiya  february   at its third congress the  uou took credit for protecting military property against  misappropriation narodnaya armiya  april   the third  congress highlighted its concern with the corruption issue by  electing security service col hryhoriy omelchenko as uou  chairman  although omelchenko has complained that he has been  prevented by conservative politicians from carrying out this  mandate see above page     the uou nonetheless remains  determined to attempt to police the military  the head of the  uou lviv oblast organization mykola vasylkevych recently  asserted that the uou will take a most active part in  inventorying and protecting military property from ships under  construction to the last cartridge shlyakh peremohy  january       social protection of servicemen     the problem of the shortage of housing and other amenities for  military officers evidently presented a dilemma for the uou  while any organization aspiring to influence among servicemen in  the former soviet union must address this issue ukraines near  catastrophic economic situation makes it difficult for any group  to deliver on its promises  although the union  characteristically at first presented itself as the guarantor  that living standards would improve it eventually backed off its  earlier aspirations and promises  it may be a testament to the  intractability of the problem that the uou officials most  identified with the social welfare issue founding chairman vilen  martirosyan and former first deputy chairman vitaliy

down human rights        summary                                          apparently seeing little merit in a policy of open confrontation  with the chinese over human rights issues and at the same time  eager to secure a share of chinas burgeoning market germany and  france have avoided all but the most muted public criticism of  chinas human rights record while steadily expanding diplomatic  and trade contacts  german and french media while supportive of  improved relations with china have expressed doubts about the  wisdom of sof tpedaling the human rights issue and yielding to  chinas demand to stop selling arms to taiwan                                       end summary     in marked contrast to recent us policy both germany and france  have chosen a lowkey approach to the issue of chinese human  rights violations arguing that it is more effective to promote  democratic development through strengthened economic relations  than through public admonitions  germanys efforts including  lifting sanctions against china and yielding to chinas  insistence that it not sell submarines to taiwan culminated in  chancellor helmut kohls trip to china in november  and the  signing of several large contracts  similarly following months  of diplomatic efforts to repair a rift in relations triggered by  frances sale of mirage airplanes to taiwan in november   france and china normalized relations on  january  in return  for two key french concessionsrecognition of the prc government  as the sole legal government of china and taiwan as an  integral part of chinese territory and agreement not to  authorize any french enterprises to sell arms to taiwanchina  agreed to welcome participation by french firms in china on an  equal footing according to a joint communique xinhua   january     germanys quiet diplomacy     german leaders have repeatedly defended the governments policy  of not pressuring the chinese publicly on human rights and  instead promoting change through economic relations and behind  thescenes efforts  both kohl and foreign minister klaus kinkel  have stressed that germanys approach on chinese human rights is  to use quiet diplomacy and to promote progress on human rights  and democracy in china through trade and economic reform     even after the recent roundup of chinese dissidents the german  reaction was limited to an expression of concern over the  arrests and a caution issued by a foreign ministry spokesman  that the arrests could clearly disturb germanchinese  relations  indicating that even in this case the usual german  nonpublic diplomacy was being followed the spokesman said berlin  had approached beijing on this matter the previous week dpa   march     explaining germanys approach to the human rights issue kinkel  told german ambassadors to asia on  january that wagging an  admonishing finger at the chinese would not be productive  because europeans cannot impose their cultural principles on  the asian countries  dignity so important in asia he said  had to be respected  he argued that instead of public  confrontation it would be more effective to be secretly active  to help in concrete cases of human rights violations frankfurter  rundschau  january  apparently with the united states in  mind kinkel contrasted germanys approach to those who bang  their fists on the table and declared that the west cannot  enforce everything with pressure on the leadership das  parlament  december      during his trip to china kohl defended his approach on human  rights saying that he had had an intensive talk on human  rights with chinas leaders but that it was not a subject for  public discussion ntv  november  history has shown  he argued in another interview that freedom leads to more  freedom and that free economic development has an impact on  human rights and the freedom of the citizens ard  november       german press questions policy     until the arrest of chinese dissidents in early march media  reaction had been largely supportive of the governments trade  initiatives in china and its lowkey approach to the human rights  issue  the munich daily sueddeutsche zeitung even said in a   january commentary that kohl and kinkels efforts on human rights  could serve as a model for dealing with china because they  demonstrated that valueoriented foreign policy does not have  to be an exercise in fingerpointing  since the largescale  arrests however the press has questioned this policy  criticizing both germany and the united states for acceding to  chinas demands and suggesting that the wests approach is giving  beijing every reason to believe that the west will do nothing to  jeopardize trade relations     following the arrest of prominent chinese dissidents in early  march the influential daily frankfurter allgemeine on  march  said the chinese government had shown what it thought of western  criticism  namely nothing  for the sake of economic  interests the west will continue to turn a blind eye to the  political suppression in china and even more so in tibet because  the chinese market is too enticing  europes argument that the  closer the economic ties the greater the chances for  political loosening up has proved illusionary     on  february frankfurter allgemeine chastized the german  government for the shameful way in which the city of frankfurt  had officially invited and then uninvited the tibetan dalai  lama to a celebration of frankfurts  anniversary calling  the move an unnecessary kowtow and an undignified retreat in  the face of chinas unreasonable demands     the leftofcenter frankfurter rundschau of  march said that  just as during kohls trip to china beijing seems to have come  to the conclusion that all western admonitions on human rights  are meant halfheartedly     france pleased     in announcing renewed relations with china foreign minister  alain juppe avoided any mention of human rights issues while  saying that the political weight of china and its economic  power justified frances decision to resume the ties of trust  he expressed hope that this could be brought about through an  intense political dialogue with beijing and strengthening of  economic relations franceinter radio  january     although they avoided pressing the chinese on the issue french  leaders apparently did mention human rights in subsequent  meetings with chinese foreign minister qian qichen  following a  meeting with qian in paris on  january juppe spoke of a new  departure in relations with china saying that he had addressed  the issue of human rights with qian and that a lot must still be  done by china in that area afp  january  frances special  envoy to china alain peyrefitte addressed the issue with great  subtlety according to le figaro of  january when he said at  dinner with qian in china that france while it was unwilling to  impinge on a sovereign states internal affairs could not be  insensitive to matters relating to the respect of individual and  group freedoms     skeptical french press     the french press has criticized the governments failure to press  the human rights issue and has largely been skeptical of  prospects for significantly improved trade relations  several  commentaries attacked the government for yielding to chinas  demands on taiwan and expressed pique at what they viewed as  chinas favoritism toward the united states which they saw as  having maintained relations with taiwan without incurring chinese  retribution     the influential daily le monde was particularly skeptical  an  editorial on  january expressed doubt about the terms of the  joint communique saying that the chinese have shown how little  regard they attach to their promises of trade advantages  as  for human rights it charged beijing is convinced that  hypocritical western concerns for human rights will eventually  be superseded by greed  on  january le monde wrote  sardonically that normalization of relations with china indeed  represented a new departure since commercial interests had  now displaced the memory of the tiananmen massacre which the  french government at the time had denounced with a determination  unmatched throughout the world     a commentary published in liberation of  february charged the  french government with obsequiousness and grovelling toward  beijing in pledging not to sell weapons to taiwan  chinas  rulers do not respect the rules accepted by the international  community with regard to human rights weapons sales or external  trade the commentary said noting that the united states  remained the only country that still dares to say no to china  liberation  february  author shaver questions andor comments please call chief  analyst

state duma to amnesty prisoners  implicated in the august  coup and the october  supreme  soviet uprising marks the dumas most confrontational move  against president boris yeltsin to date it was passed as part of  a compromise package that somewhat mitigated its anti  presidential thrust  centrists and moderate reformers supported  the amnesty after hardliners gave up a legislative commission  that was to have investigated last autumns constitutional crisis  and agreed to accept an additional document defining the amnesty  as part of a movement toward national reconciliation  the  amnesty vote appears to have weakened yeltsin politically and has  deepened the divisions among reformers further undermining their  ability to fight the antiyeltsin opposition in the legislature                             end summary     hardliners in the duma scored a political victory over yeltsin  when with the help of centrists and moderate reformers the duma  adopted on  february a package of decrees amnestying prisoners  charged in the  coup attempt and the  uprising including  yeltsins archenemies ruslan khasbulatov and aleksandr rutskoy  the duma had debated but failed to approve a political amnesty  several times previously but proponents scored a breakthrough on   february when the dumas council put together a large  compromise package that included decrees on a criminal and  political amnesty a memorandum calling for national accord and  a decree that apparently abolishes a duma commission established  on  february to investigate the events of  september to   october see box  radio rossii  february segodnya   february  legislative hardliners had intended to use the  commission to attack yeltsin by publicly questioning the  constitutionality of his edict dissolving the supreme soviet  during the councils session hardliners reportedly agreed to  act as if the vote on setting up the commission never took  place a choice that reportedly caused considerable anguish  among more extreme yeltsin opponents who did not want to give up  the commission segodnya  february sovetskaya rossiya   february     how the factions voted     the compromise amnesty package passed  to  with   abstentionsjust  votes above the required majoritywith the  bulk of support coming from hardline deputies  according to an  account by a communist party cprf deputy published in  sovetskaya rossiya  february the cprf agrarian party  liberal democratic party of russia ldpr and the hardline  nationalist russian way group led by sergey baburin provided   votes for the compromise amnesty package  some hardliners  however including nine cprf deputies and one each from the  agrarian party and russian way were so intent on retaining the  dumas investigative commission into the septemberoctober crisis  that they voted against the final compromise     after a decree abolishing the investigative commission was added  to the large package enough centrists and moderate reformers  joined in supporting the amnesty compromise to put it over the  top  apparently at the urging of party of russian unity and  accord pres leader sergey shakhray pres and the women of  russia faction joined by at least some members of the centrist  new regional policy group made their support for the amnesty  package contingent on the inclusion of a memorandum of accord  essentially a political declaration calling for round table talks  on economic and political issues and recommending amnesty as a  step toward national reconciliation interfax  february  even with the inclusion of the memorandum of accord however  this small amnesty package did not have enough support to pass  only two pres deputies voted for the small package  when the  decree abolishing the commission was added to the large  compromise package it gained the votes of  more pres deputies  of  present to vote  similarly  deputies from the new  regional policy group voted for the small package but an  additional  members voted for the final compromise that  abolished the commission  other centrist deputies voting for the  final compromise included all  members from women of russia and  all  deputies from the nikolay travkins democratic party of  russia faction who were present to vote sovetskaya rossiya   february     the compromise package appears to have deepened divisions among  reformers pitting the

political amnesty with  only one of its membersivan starikov of novosibirskwilling to  vote for the final compromise moskovskiy komsomolets  march  however only  of its  members were present to vote

background to the amnesty issue     since convening the duma has debated two kinds of amnesty  proposals one a criminal amnesty aimed at minor offenders and  the other a political amnesty for the  coup plotters and  participants in the  supreme soviet uprising  during the  first week of the dumas session hardline deputies made their  first move toward securing a political amnesty for their  political allies but their failure to coordinate with the ldpr  which was pressing its own political amnesty proposal caused the  move to fail itartass  january sovetskaya rossiya   january  yeltsin revived the amnesty issue when he submitted a  proposal for a criminal amnesty in connection with the adoption  of the constitution rossiyskaya gazeta  january continuing  a sovietera tradition of declaring amnesties to mark major  holidays and significant political milestones  in retrospect  this move was doubly unfortunate for yeltsin  his proposal  failed to attract support from reformers and gave hardliners  another opportunity to raise the issue of a political amnesty      on  january vasiliy lipitskiy a close associate of  rutskoy proposed putting the political amnesty issue on the  dumas agenda but the motion fell  votes short of a majority  reportedly because the ldpr did not back him itartass   january sovetskaya rossiya  january nezavisimaya gazeta   january  at the time the ldpr was advocating an amnesty that  would have freed anyone sentenced on political or economic  charges after april  and also would have released from jail  rutskoy khasbulatov and other participants in the october  uprising but placed them under house arrest interfax   december  itartass  january      yeltsins proposal submitted shortly after he signed it on   january quickly ran into trouble  the cprf and agrarian party  were unwilling to consider it because it did not amnesty their  political allies and the ldpr stood by its version  even  russias choicethe faction most likely to support the  presidentwas unwilling to back the bill apparently in an  effort to erase public perceptions that it is soft on crime  faction leader yegor gaydar stated that russias choice could not  support yeltsins initiative because we are very doubtful about  the provisions    which reduce punishments for serious  criminal offenses and pointedly drew attention to the existing  criminal situation in the country itartass  january   february  in a further indication of trouble for yeltsin his  proposal was assigned to the committee for legislation judicial  and legal reform headed by vladimir isakova staunch yeltsin  foe from the agrarian party itartass  january      the amnesty issue was scheduled to come up for debate in the  dumas  february plenary session but the dumas council  postponed the debate probably in recognition that none of the  competing proposals would win a majority interfax segodnya   february  according to the dumas first deputy chairman mikhail  mityukov russias choice the council postponed debate because  certain factions wanted to play the amnesty card for political  purposes izvestiya   february  by that time isakovs  committee had drafted its own decree to amnesty the participants  in the  coup attempt and the october uprising segodnya   february      by midfebruary elements of the final compromise began to  emerge as the duma agreed to examine both yeltsins criminal  amnesty proposal and an apparently revised ldpr political amnesty  proposal  the duma took no direct action on yeltsins criminal  amnesty proposal during its  february debate possibly because  the debate made it clear that it lacked majority support  nezavisimaya gazeta kommersantdaily  february  the duma  then decided to consider separately two draft decreesyeltsins  on a criminal amnesty and an ldpr proposal on an economic and  political amnesty interfax itartass  february  more  ominously for yeltsin the pres and women of russia factions  offered conditional backing for the political amnesty reportedly  insisting on circulating a clarification document evidently  a reference to the memorandum of accord that the duma later  adopted in the final compromise packagemaking it clear that the  factions supported the amnesty as a step toward national  reconciliation and not simply for the sake of freeing rutskoy  and khasbulatov segodnya  february  on  february the  ldprs political amnesty proposal fell  votes short of adoption  and was sent back to committee for improvement this time going  to the security committee headed by yeltsin foe viktor ilyukhin  cprf as well as to isakovs legislation committee interfax  itartass  february     disarray in the yeltsin camp     the varied responses from yeltsins advisers to the dumas  passage of the amnesty suggest that the event caught them  unprepared even though the approval of the compromise package by  the dumas council on  february should have given them some  warning of its improved prospects see note   national  security adviser yuriy baturin opted for a confrontational  stance arguing that the amnesty was unconstitutional because it  was in fact a pardon which is a presidential prerogative itar  tass  february rossiyskaya gazeta  february  by  contrast aleksandr m yakovlev yeltsins official  representative to the legislature responded in sanguine fashion  contending that the amnesty was completely in keeping with the  constitution from a judicial point of view russian tv   february  georgiy satarov a yeltsin adviser on legislative  relations did not weigh in until two days after the vote when  he indicated that yeltsin was preparing a calm and businesslike  letter asking the duma to reconsider its stance interfax  moscow radio ostankino tv  february     note   much of the disarray in the yeltsin camp may be  attributed to the absence of presidential administration leader  sergey filatov who was apparently in switzerland at the time  itartass  february  yakovlev satarov and baturin are all  relatively new to the yeltsin team and their inexperience may  have contributed to their uncoordinated response for more on  yeltsins advisers see the trends of  march  pages      yeltsin himself responded too late to postpone or block  implementation of the political amnesty  on  february he sent  a letter to duma chairman ivan rybkin drawing upon baturins  line of argument and reportedly asserting that the deputies had  confused the constitutional principles of amnesty and pardon  the letter urged the duma to improve the decree to bring it in  line with the constitution  yeltsin also proposed that the duma  adopt a system of criteria defining the responsibility of state  institutions and politicians for decisions  hamper our  joint policy towards national reconciliation civil peace and  accordevidently an attempt to impress upon the duma its  accountability for the actions of individuals released under the  amnesty itartass  february  satarov reportedly delivered  yeltsins letter to rybkin on the afternoon of  february when  rutskoy khasbulatov and other prisoners arrested after the  october uprising were already walking out of lefortovo prison  see box  itartass  february rossiyskaya gazeta  izvestiya  march     after the futile letter to rybkin yeltsin appeared to waver  between taking a confrontational approach and trying to defuse  political tensions  at first he was confrontational with  satarov announcing on  february that yeltsin was preparing  certain actions aimed at defending the democratic state and  society russian tv  february  satarovs comments and  others by baturin and presidential press secretary vyacheslav  kostikov fueled speculation that yeltsin would address the  country that night in a special televised appeal itartass   february  nezavisimaya gazetas ivan rodin reported  march  that yeltsin was to have announced on television an edict that  while not containing any specific tough measures nonetheless  brandished a menacing tone  rodin also suggested however  that threatening a tough presidential response may have been a  deliberate tactic to bring pressure on rybkin before a meeting  held the same day between yeltsins advisersincluding the newly  returned head of administration sergey filatovand rybkin  rybkin and filatov reportedly discussed ways to improve  interaction between the two branches paving the way for  yeltsin to meet with rybkin the following day itartass   february     after his meeting with rybkin yeltsin appears to have adopted a  position of accepting the amnesty and placing the burden of  responsibility for itand for the actions of the released  prisonerssquarely on the duma  at their  march meeting  rybkin reportedly promised yeltsin that the duma would ensure a  more balanced approach when adopting decrees likely to have  serious political and moral consequences itartass  march  yeltsin apparently also extracted a pledge from rybkin that he  would urge the duma probably in the near future to adopt a  memorandum on the responsibility of state institutions and  politicians for preserving civic calm in russia moscow radio   march  in return yeltsin assured rybkin that he had opted  against immediate tough measures but he warned that he would  not tolerate misbehavior by his amnestied foes saying should  the slightest attempt be made at destabilizing the situation in  the country  will be arrested straight  after itartass  march     as a result of the initial confused reaction by his advisers and  the conflicting signals about his course of action yeltsin  appears to have lost political stature in the aftermath of the  amnesty vote  his acceptance of the amnesty conflicts with his  repeated assertionsmost recently stated at the  march  government meetingthat the dumas amnesty is unconstitutional  moscow radio  march  in an effort to counter press accounts  of executive disarray rossiyskaya gazeta izvestiya  march as  well as criticism of his handling of the amnesty by russias  choice members izvestiya  march yeltsin apparently saw the  need to verbally assert his presidential authority after meeting  with rybkin i    am in full control of the social and  political situation itartass  march     implications     the dumas successful passage of a political amnesty suggests  that yeltsin and his team of advisers have learned little since  the confrontation with the old supreme soviet about how to manage  relations with the legislative branch much less to effectively  advance a presidential agenda  by contrast the duma has again  demonstrated its ability to compromise effectively on issues it  considers important with the duma council apparently playing a  key role  by postponing debate when it recognized that the duma  lacked consensus on the issue and brokering the final key  compromise the dumas leadership demonstrated a knack for

crisis was not  included in an earlier small package that failed to pass      on declaring an amnesty in connection with the adoption of  the russian federation constitution  this decree based largely  on the draft amnesty bill that yeltsin submitted to parliament  rossiyskaya gazeta  january amnesties criminals convicted  of minor offenses as well as certain groups of offenders such as  women and

bitterly by yeltsin supporters  specifically terminates legal proceedings against the  coup  plotters and hardliners arrested after the violent  may  demonstrations in moscow and the october  supreme soviet  uprising and stipulates that their release from prison take place  immediately  in an apparent effort to gain the support of some  reformers and the liberal democratic party of russia ldpr it

counting on  prosecutor general aleksey kazannik to block or delay  implementation of the amnesty  kazanniks office reportedly made  an inquiry to the duma about certain provisions in the amnesty  and rybkin indicated in his meeting with satarov on  february  that the dumas legislation and security committees were  responding to the inquiry and that no prisoners would be released  until the questions were cleared up itartass  february  at  a meeting of parliamentary officials on  february rybkin  charged that the prosecutors office acted on the amnesty with  undue haste and without waiting for a response to its questions  interfax radio rossii  february  he later appeared to  change his story somewhatpossibly in an attempt to deflect  blame from the security and legislation

amnesty but kazannik while declaring his  distaste for the amnesty said that he had no legal authority to  block it and resigned rather than submit to yeltsins pressure  kazannik had implicitly warned yeltsin that he would not bow to  political pressures over the amnesty issue when he stated that  his office does not give political assessments to various laws  but only ensures their lawfulness and strict fulfillment itar  tass  february  in his resignation statement kazannik  charged that yeltsin had appealed to him to suspend the amnesty  process and though he indicated that he personally agreed with  the civic attitude of yeltsins appeal he made clear his  professional and political independence the prosecutor in  russia does not have the authority to suspend an amnesty act   to appeal to the state duma for a resolution to be  reconsidered itartass  february  despite his refusal to  delay implementing the amnesty kazannik appears to harbor no  sympathy for the amnestied prisoners asserting in his  resignation statement that he considered the dumas vote for  political amnesty a black page in the history of russian  parliamentarianism itartass  february      kazannik has now changed his mind about resigning and has  indicated that he will ask the federation council which has the  constitutional authority to confirm the appointment and dismissal  of the prosecutor general not to accept his  february  resignation russian tv izvestiya  march  yeltsin however  appears intent on securing kazanniks resignation  on  march  he issued a decree affirming his acceptance

the hebron  massacre plo leaders also appear to be maintaining a degree of  flexibility in their position on terms for resuming peace  negotiations with israel  in addition plo statements aimed at  palestinian audiences appear to be preparing popular opinion for  a compromise                                       end summary     following meetings in tunis between palestinian leaders and  delegations from israel and the united states plo executive  committee member yasir abdrabbuh reiterated plo demands that  israel must take action against jewish settlers in the occupied  territories before the plo will agree to resume negotiations  meetings with us officials he told an interviewer have not  achieved progress and he complained that washington is seeking  to link issuance of a security council resolution on the hebron  massacre to plo acceptance of a date for resumption of  negotiations  a security council resolution abdrabbuh argued  would be effective only if it ensures practical steps    to  guarantee international protection for the palestinian people  and should not be a bargaining card to resume talks  more  specifically he called for ending the settlers presence in the  heart of hebron and other areas constituting hotbeds of tension  and explosion tackling the issue of the presence of armed  settlers    in palestinian towns and villages and providing  international protection especially in hebron radio monte  carlo  march     other recent statements by mainstream plo leaders and media have  also stressed that israel must act against settlers and that  security for palestinians in the territories must be ensured but  the statements appear to have been carefully crafted to avoid  taking any uncompromising positions that might threaten  resumption of negotiations  for example     plo leader yasir arafat branded jewish settlements in hebron  as illegal in an interview with a french newspaper but said  that he is not asking for them to be destroyed but moved  he  also repeated his call for an international presence in the  territories to ensure palestinian security but appeared careful  to couch the demand in terms designed not to offend israel  such  an international presence he said would be consistent with the  provisions of the israelplo declaration of principles dopa  condition laid down by israeli leaders  in addition arafat  suggested an armed international force only when questioned  explicitly on the subject asking rhetorically who will protect  this international force  the armed jewish settlers and  answering that the observers must protect themselves  similarly cautious on us policy arafat complained that the  united states is blocking inclusion of any reference to jerusalem  in the un security council resolution currently under discussion  but was circumspect overall in commenting on us policy  we  must    wait until the whole us reaction is revealed at all  levels and not just in the security council he said and he  asked rhetorically whether the united states will be up to the  responsibilities which it has shouldered since the signing of  this dop  he also demanded that israel complete withdrawal from  the gaza strip and jericho by  april in keeping with the dop  but when asked what he would do if the deadline was not met he  answered only that would mean that the israeli government had  decided not to respect our agreements paris le figaro il  march     commenting on israels decision to ban extremist settler  organizations plo official ahmad quray a key figure in  negotiating the dop described the israeli action as a good step  in the right direction but not enough  there must be he  added a more substantial solution specifying that measures  must be taken around the ibrahimi mosque sight of the hebron  massacre and the locations of settlers ool yisrael   march     a plo radio commentary excoriated the united states for  allegedly blocking a security council resolution on the hebron  massacre but avoided any explicit threats or demands  the  united states the radio charged is resisting this desire for  justice by the international community and displaying its  support for bias toward and collusion with israel that is in  favor of terrorism crime and massacre  washingtons strange  and abnormal logic the commentary added runs counter to  justice and history and destroys the foundations of the peace  process to the detriment not only of palestinians but of all  parties including israel and the protector of its terrorism the  united states voice of palestine  in yemen  march     preparing palestinian opinion for a deal     two recent commentaries in plo media addressed to palestinian  audiences strongly suggest that the plo leadership mindful of  popular palestinian anger following the hebron massacre is  attempting gradually to prepare palestinian opinion to accept an  eventual compromise formula on resuming formal peace negotiations  with israel     a vop commentary said that arafat is under strong pressure to  leave the peace talks but argued that the peace process must  continue  palestinians the commentary said are seeking a more  effective us role following the massacre but it warned that  there are limits to what the clinton administration can do in  its dealing with the yitzhaq rabin government and that the plo  should be satisfied with achieving limited gains  what will  eventually be required vop argued is to effect a balance  between the palestinian and israeli negotiators  although  palestinian gains may initially be limited the commentary  concluded unquestionably the decision to go ahead with the  negotiations will achieve more significant gains in the future  a conclusion it justified by noting that for the first time  the    issue of settlements    is being raised inside the  israeli government itself  march     an article appearing in the plos weekly news magazine  acknowledged that the plos demand for a security council  resolution condemning the massacre calling for an international  presence in the occupied territories    and indicating that  jerusalem is part of the occupied territories as a condition for  resuming bilateral talks with israel could result in some sort  of confrontation with the united states  nonetheless the  article continued the plo realizes that the united states has a  genuine interest in resuming the negotiations as soon as  possible along with other members of the international  community  moreover the article argued israels position is  weak thus giving the plo a chance for better political gains  than previously offered to it  under these circumstances the  article concluded it is inevitable that the plo return to the  negotiating table  the plo it explained is not in the  business of revenge governed by instant angry reactions but is  seeking a political achievement that may return things to the  right track and make up for our loss in the negotiations on the  dop in davos and cairo filistin althawrah  march     implications     plo leaders clearly see an opportunity following the hebron  massacre to extract concessions on some issues most notably  settlements on which they deferred to israeli demands during  negotiations leading to the dop  moreover they are undoubtedly  also concerned that they must be seen to have made significant  political gains before returning to negotiations in order to  satisfy angry and skeptical palestinians in the territories  arafat has almost certainly decided that he must eventually  continue negotiations on the dop but judging by his conduct of  the talks leading to the cairo agreement in february he will  seek to prolong the current diplomatic maneuvering until he is  convinced he can make no further gains     author morton  questions andor comments please call chief  near east analysis branch    eneagbloughcb  mar                        march   article typefbis  due to

operating  current      nippon electric co ltd nec has developed a new type of  semiconductor laser that begins to emit infrared radiation when  stimulated by an electric current of  microamperes according to  a report in nikkei sangyo shimbun  jan  this amperagethe  worlds lowest operating currentis reported to be less than one  tenth the current used by conventional semiconductor lasers and nec  expects it to lead to a large reduction in electric power  consumption by highspeed optoelectric integrated circuit devices  used in optical communications and optical computers      the nec laser is a sandwich of crystalline film layers stacked  on a substrate by molecular beam epitaxy infrared radiation with a  wavelength of  micron generated in the optically active middle  layer is emitted from the top surface of the laser in a direction  perpendicular to the substrate instead of horizontally from the side  of the laser as is the case with conventional semiconductor lasers  unlike the latter the nec laser is easily focused and can be  integrated with optoelectronic devices in a fashion analagous to an  ordinary transistor      in experiments the nec laser began to emit radiation when the  injection current reached  microamperes  when the current was  raised to  milliamperes optical output power reached   microwatts the nec researchers kept radiation loss to a minimum by  making the thickness of the active layer equal to the radiation  wavelength the laser is limited to pulsed emission operation but  nec intends to develop a method to reduce the laser elements  resistance in order to make it suitable for continuous emission      john h       japan quantum box laser      the tokyo institute of technology has conducted experiments at   degrees c on a quantum box laser that generates pulses of  infrared radiation at a wavelength of  microns and requires only   amperes of current for oscillation the laser element consists  of a planesurface indium gallium arsenide ingaas film with many  microscopic particles of ingaas arranged in a grid pattern and  embedded in the film the particles are  nanometers apart and each  is  nanometers in diameter and  nanometers thick the ingaas  film laser element is sandwiched between insulating layers of indium  phosphide unlike electrons in the thinfilm layers of conventional  semiconductor lasers electrons confined in the pointlike particle  boxes of the new laser cannot move in any dimension so they can  emit radiation with virtually no waste according to the  researchers      after development is complete the laser is expected to perform at  room temperature  researchers believe the ultrahigh radiation  efficiency will make it possible to operate it using only a few  tenths of the electric power required by conventional  semiconductors the institute expects that the new laser will be  used in optical communications and optical computers because it  consumes little power and generates little heat even when several  lasers are grouped together nikkei sangyo shimbun  nov       john h       france research on lowtemperature superconductivity      two groups of french

cuprate compounds at  temperatures ranging from  degrees  c  to   degrees c at normal  pressure according to afp sciences  dec  this breakthrough  follows the teams september  experiment which achieved  superconductivity at  k and  kilobars of pressure and which  demonstrated that critical temperature rises at the rate of  k  per kilobar as the atomic density of cuprates increases with  increasing pressure previous research  achieved the same result by  replacing certain atoms in a compound with others the experimental  samples were  cubic millimeters in size and consisted of mercury  barium calcium and copper oxide phases  a dramatic drop in  electrical resistance was observed in seven samples and diamagnetism  was observed in  samples at temperatures ranging from  k to   k

bosnian serbs have not ruled out some type of future  political links with the muslimcroatian federation in bosnia  herzegovina and croatia  bosnian serb president radovan  karadzic suggested that the rs is willing to consider broader  integration of the territories of former yugoslavia broaching  the idea of joining croatia and the fry together into some  relationship with the rs and the rsk

agreement out  of hand belgrade has not indicated any willingness to negotiate  within the terms of the plan  milosevic stopped just short of  rejecting the plan after talking with greek foreign minister  karolos papoulias releasing a statement that made no mention of  the plan but endorsed a peace settlement based on the november   european union plan for a union of three sovereign states in  bosniaherzegovina tanjug  march  at the same time  apparently not wanting to be held responsible for rejecting the  washington agreement milosevic maintained what churkin called a  flexible attitude toward a bosnian settlement at their  march  meeting a point that was stressed on miloseviccontrolled  belgrade television belgrade tv  march  other comments from  yugoslav leaders and media have reiterated the position that the  serbs do not oppose a muslimcroatian federation as long as it  does not threaten serbian interests while at the same time  expressing skepticism that such a federation can long survive  belgrade radio  march belgrade tv  march     bosnian government stand     the bosnian government has rejected serbian proposals for  confederal ties linking bosniaherzegovina with the fry and  insisted that the serbs will not be allowed to alter the borders  of the country by seceding with the territory they control  while inviting the serbs to sign on to the washington agreement  president alija izetbegovic flatly declared during an interview  with zagreb television that a confederation between bosnia  herzegovina and the fry is out of the question  he also warned  that the serbs would not be allowed to snatch away part of  bosnia and attach it to serbia  although he did not rule out  the possibility of certain forms of cooperationspecifically  economic cooperation between the states of the former  yugoslavia he contended that no serious responsible people  were considering the creation of a new yugoslavia zagreb tv   march     croatias stance     the croatian government has also rejected the possibility of  confederal ties between the fry and either croatia or bosnia  herzegovina  asked about krajisniks proposal to link the  serbian states with croatia and bosniaherzegovina foreign  minister mate granic flatly declared it absolutely impossible  to accept  he further stressed that under no circumstances  would croatia consider any kind of relationship linking it  directly or indirectly with the fry  attributing the proposal  to churkin granic said that he had conveyed his negative views  very firmly to both the russians and the bosnian government  zagreb tv  march  although president franjo tudjman has not  directly rejected ties between the bosnian state and the fry he  did offhandedly dismiss the idea during a  march press  conference in responding to a question on the subject zagreb  radio  march     implications     the croat and bosnian governments refusal to accept a confederal  relationship between the bosnian serbs and the fry appears to  doom any possibility however remote that the serbs will agree  to the washington plan  in the near term the serbs are likely  to continue combat operations to secure territory linking their  enclaves into one entity with the aim of declaring the new lines  of demarcation to be the borders of their republic  although  they may be willing to make territorial concessions in exchange  for concessions from the bosnian government and the international  communityparticularly lifting the un sanctions on belgrade  they are likely to continue to pursue the goal

grant the iaea just enough  access to its nuclear sites to prevent the collapse of usdprk  talks a strategy that may be aimed at retaining maximum  bargaining leverage with washington                                       end summary     although pyongyang media have not yet commented on the outcome of  the iaea inspection teams justcompleted visit to north korea  the south korean news agency yonhap on  march cited iaea  spokesman hans meyer as saying that although the iaea inspection  team was allowed to inspect north koreas seven declared sites  it was not permitted to examine every item on its original  agenda  similarly seouls  kbsi radio the same day cited the  iaea team as reporting that compared with past inspections there  had been improvement in inspection activities allowed during  the iaea teams latest visit  however the team could not  extract enough samples to prove definitively whether or not north  korea had diverted nuclear materials for uses other than what it  had declared according to the radio     not surprisingly pyongyang is pursuing an equally minimalist  strategy in its talks with south korea  pyongyang radio on   march accused seoul of attempting to obstruct upcoming dprkus  highlevel talks by blocking progress at the latest round of  interkorean talks  according to the radio at the latest round  the north adhered to its reasonable insistence that the sides  issue a joint communique declaring their basic intent to realize  an exchange of special envoys at an early date  pyongyang radio  also asserted that the south had refused to accept the norths  version of a draft agreement on procedural matters and claimed  that seoul is deliberately creating difficulties bent on  putting the brakes on dprkus talks tentatively set to start  in geneva on  march     pyongyang seems to be calculating that by making limited  concessions at the northsouth talks it can cast the south in  the role of obstructing the planned talks with washington  for  example according to pyongyang radio accounts of the  march  meeting the north korean chief delegate juxtaposed the norths  broadminded and epochmaking willingness to lift four demands  that north korea previously advanced in the talks to the souths  sanctimonious rejection of north korean proposals     interest in foreign trade     despite its stance on iaea  inspections and northsouth contacts pyongyang also seems to be  tempering its hardline stance by carefully signaling that its  longterm goal is to reach a peaceful settlement of the nuclear  issue  to this end the north korean news agency kcna waited  until  marchthe day a foreign ministry spokesman issued a  threatening statement about us preconditions on dprkus  talksto publicize a set of free trade zone regulations that had  been adopted on  february  the regulations concern the  operation of foreign businesses within north korean free trade  zones  similarly the next day kcna reported on regulations  also adopted on  february for the implementation of the tax  law on foreign enterprises  both sets of trade regulations  presuppose an influx of foreign investment into north korea an  event not likely to occur without a peaceful resolution of the  nuclear issue     implications     pyongyang media treatment of recent developments  concerning the nuclear issue suggests that the north korean  leadership may believe that it has already given washington  enough incentives so that it would not be willing to risk the  heightening of tensions on the korean peninsula by breaking off  usdprk talks  pyongyang appears to be trying to retain as  much of its nuclear card and control over the interkorean  issues as possible in order to enhance its position at any future  bilateral negotiations with washington

supreme  soviet election a very large number of candidates are competing  for most of the  parliamentary seats guaranteeing many  runoffs and even raising the possibility that not enough deputies  may be elected to form a parliament  activity by parties varies  widelystrong in lviv and donetsk but weak in many other places  with nationalist and democratic parties likely to run well in the  west leftist and liberal parties in the east but nonparty  candidates likely to win the most seats nationwide prospects are  for a badly splintered supreme soviet with weak parties and  little ability to resolve the countrys tough problems                                       end summary     easy filing requirements and lax filing deadlines contributed to  the flood of candidates  according to the election law  candidates had to file only  signatures by  days before the  election late january to become a candidate for candidate and  then  signatures by  days before the election ie   february to become a registered candidate vidomosti verkhovnoi  rady ukrainy  november   although plenty of candidates  had already qualified the central electoral commission cec  allowed registration to continue after  february nezavisimost   february apparently until individual local electoral  commissions decided to close it  robitnycha hazeta reported on   february that registration had ended in  of the   districts and holos ukrainy reported on  february that all  registration had finally ended on  february  in late february  the cec reported that   percent of the  candidates  for candidate had been registered as final candidates holos  ukrainy  march  the lists of candidates began appearing in  local papers in midfebruary and candidates began appearing on  local television in groupsfor example the  candidates for  kiev city district no  were slated to make the first joint  appearance on  february vecherniy kiev  february     parties role limited     parties played a limited role in putting forward candidates  formally nominating only a small percentage of the candidates in  most districts  groups of voters nominated   percent  work collectives   percent while parties nominated only    percent according to the  march holos ukrainy  however some areas such as lviv and donetsk had a much higher  proportion of party nominees than the republicwide  percent  see box      in reality however there are far more partyaffiliated  candidates on the ballot than party nominations would indicate  because some who were identified with a party in local papers  were nominated by groups of electors or collectives  in kiev  oblast only  candidates were nominated by parties but   candidates actually belong to parties kiyvska pravda   january  and in donetsk lists of candidates for the first   districts in vecherniy donetsk identified one third to one half  of the candidates in most districts as affiliated with parties  far more than the number nominated by parties     at the same time not all candidates affiliated with a party are  endorsed as candidates by the party  a dempu democratic party  of ukraine candidate is running against former defense minister  kostyantyn morozov in kiev district no  but dempu itself is  backing morozov samostiyna ukraina  february     so far no parties have published republicwide lists of their  candidates and though several publicly set a goal of running  candidates in all districts it appears none came close  few  parties have even provided numbers of their candidates  the  paper rada published by rukh chairman vyacheslav chornovil on   march carried an article reporting that rukh members were running  in  of the  districts and that there also were dozens of  independent candidates who support rukh and promise to join  rukhs faction if elected  the urps paper samostiyna ukraina   february reported that the urp had registered   candidates including  in lviv  in kiev  in ternopil and   in ivanofrankivsk while the dempu was running fewer  including only  in kiev city  the postpostup news agency  reported that a  january una ukrainian national assembly  press conference announced  candidates  in kiev  in  poltava and cherkassy  in donbass  in rivne  in kiev  oblast  in odesa ternopil mykolaiv kherson and vinnytsa  the central electoral commission announced that the cpu was  running the most  percent of all

demokratychna ukraina  march     joint candidacies     another of the reasons for the limited number of partynominated  candidates may be agreement among parties to back each others  candidates to avoid fratricidal contests between likeminded  parties  in the initial months after announcement of the  election success at uniting parties behind candidates was very  limited  more recently levko lukyanenko head of the ukraine  democratic union the latest name for the coordinating organ set  up by democratic parties in december has claimed that  democratic parties have made great progress in agreeing on  candidates  he said at a february press conference that  democratic parties had agreed on a single candidate in over   of the  districts kiyvska pravda  february  in another  version of his remarksgiven in the  february silski visti and   february khreshchatykhe reportedly said there were agreed  candidates in  districts  he named candidates in  kiev  oblast districts that the ukraine union would back with both  organizational and financial support kiyvska pravda   february     rukh chairman and longtime lukyanenko foe vyacheslav chornovil  took a more pessimistic view than lukyanenko of democratic  parties success in uniting behind agreed candidates  in a   february sribna zemlya interview chornovil said that the  ukraine union was mainly just rukh the urp and dempu  the  pdvu new ukraine social democrats liberal democrats christian  democrats and the left center had not joined he said  he  also complained that in lviv the urp had fielded too many  candidates     moreover even lukyanenko admitted that democrats had been unable  to agree on candidates in  districtsmainly in lviv ivano  frankivsk and ternopil silski visti  february  in these  areas where democrats are virtually sure to win they apparently  felt less need to unite and more opportunity to win on their own  when the lviv democratic coordinating council finally announced  its list of candidates it was able to endorse an agreed  candidate in only  of the  districts in the rest it endorsed  more than one candidate or noted that some memberparties were  backing candidates other than the councils vysokyy zamok   march  lukyanenko also acknowledged that democrats had been  unable to field any candidates in  districts mainly in the   in odesa  in donetsk  in luhansk  in zaporizhzhya   in krym and  in poltava khreshchatyk  february     prospects vary in regions     lists of candidates and reports on party activity in local kiev  lviv and donetsk papers provide a sample of the varied and  complex picture in ukraines regions     kiev     party strength among candidates for kiev citys  seats is hard  to measure because in listing candidates local papers often  failed to indicate if candidates were associated with a party  among the few candidates identified with parties in the papers   were from the cpu  from the spu  from rukh  from the pdvu   from the una  from the tjkrp ukrainian conservative  republican party and only  from the urp and the liberal party  and none from dempu or new ukraine  fiftyeight were  specifically identified as nonpartisan  most of the rest of the  almost  candidates listed in the paper khreshchatyk were not  identified with any party or even identified as nonpartisan     although few kiev candidates bear the rukh label rukh should

supreme soviet  deputy chairman volodymyr hrynyov which appears active in  kharkiv and dnipropetrovsk     a new local donetsk bloc has also sprung up recently and  nominated many candidates  the peoples congress of donetsk  which backs ukrainian independence but opposes what it calls the  present speculative anarchy and wants more state control and  social protection for the public registered candidates in most  donetsk districts according to a  february demokratychna  ukraina article     dangers in electoral process     the large number of candidates and limited ability of parties to  organize support for candidates and provide some sort of order to  the competition indicates there may be few winners on the first  ballot necessitating runoffs in many districts  to win a  candidate has to get over  percent of the votes cast and votes  of at least  percent of registered voters according to the  election law in the vidomosti  november   for the  election itself to be valid  percent of the registered voters  have to vote according to the ukrainian law  these requirements  apply to all rounds of balloting  if no candidate qualifies as a  winner on the first round the two highest votegetters run in a  runoff which must be held within two weeks after the first  round  in the  december russian parliamentary election only a  plurality was needed so almost all seats were filled on the  first ballot     in addition to the difficulty of getting enough voters out to  vote and of candidates garnering a majority of the votes cast  the voting procedures may produce many invalid votes which also  could prevent anyone winning  as in past elections voters have  to cross off all candidates except the one they wish to vote for  with  or  candidates in many districts the voter has to  cross off a large number of names and if he inadvertently leaves  more than one name not crossed off the ballot will be invalid  if a voter crosses off all names his vote is valid however  in  the  december russian election russia changed over to positive  voting whereby voters put a mark only by the names of those they  wished to vote for     the prospect of many runoffs has led to concern that voters will  lose interest and too few will vote in the second round to meet  the requirements for a valid election or that even in the runoff  no one will win a majority if a substantial number of voters  cross out both candidates  in this case the election rules  provide for new elections within a month of the original election  in which all candidates in the original election would be barred  vidomosti  november   with the need to quickly come up  with new candidates who had not participated earlier it seems  likely that the quality of the candidates would decline and voter  interest may drop further producing more invalid elections and  leaving many seats unfilledperhaps even enough to prevent the  formation of a new supreme soviet     outlook     although most news reporting on the ukrainian elections has  focused on the activity of parties and their candidates most  candidates are unaffiliated and presumably they will win most  seats especially in rural areas where parties are weakest  many  of these unaffiliated may be conservativeleaning representatives  of interest groups lobbies or behindthescenes power  structures  while democrats are strong in west ukraine they  appear to have little organization or support in much of the rest  of the country further adding to the prospect for returning a  conservative legislature  there is also a danger that low voter  turnout could void the balloting in enough districts to prevent  formation of a new supreme soviet raising the prospect of a  paralysis of government     box

marks a significant albeit limited step in the very  gradual thawing of israelisyrian tiesa step that damascus  probably hopes will play well in washington and israel                             end summary      both damascus and the  delegation of israeli arabs  professed that the delegations  march visit was for the sole  purpose of extending condolences to president hafiz alasad on  the death of his son basil in january  for example jerusalem  qol yisrael  february damascus radio  march nonetheless  the event was also viewed by both sides as having clear political  significance  for their part syrias tightly controlled media  gave the visit far more extensive coverage than they did a visit  of a large druze delegation from the golan heights in september    reflecting the political nature of the visit both  president alasad and delegation head abdalwahhab darawshah  leader of the arab democratic party and knesset deputyspoke  only briefly about the death of alasads son focusing instead  almost entirely on the arabisrael peace process in televised  speeches damascus television  march      a show of support for syria      syria orchestrated the visit as a show of support for its own  policies from the peace process to the plo to syrian jews  damascus elicited the visitors vocal support via the syrian  media which carried numerous statements by darawshah extolling  syria and scoring israeli policies  for example       according to damascus radio darawshah called the destruction  of  the delegation visited on its second day in  syriaa deplorable crime and praised the heroic struggle of  the syrian armed forces supported by the heroic syrian people in  defense of arab territory  march  in his address to alasad  he asserted that we share the same position with you on the  peace process       damascus radio quoted darawshah as saying that the purpose of  his delegations visit with syrian jews was to clarify some  israeli political and public opinion issues and prove to all  who seek to distort the truth that syria does not discriminate  against the musawi community community of the followers of  moses       in an interview with damascus radio darawshah said the  delegation had found that in syria everything is abundant  freedom is available and loftiness and dignity characterize  every action by syria led by president hafiz alasad may god  preserve him  march       delegation member and knesset deputy talib alsani was even  quoted as scoring israel for trying to penetrate the arab world  economically and to propagate the idea of a middle east market  damascus radio  marcha recurrent theme in syrian media in  recent months for example a tishrin editorial as reported by  damascus radio on  february      even syrias choice of personalities to greet the delegation on  arrival at the airport was clearly meant as a statement khalid  alfahum head of a syrianbacked umbrella group of palestinian  rejectionists opposed to the plo was the only figure reported to  accompany the governor of damascus to the airport damascus  radio  march  the syrians thus created the appearance of an  affinity between israeli arabs and palestinians supported by  damascus while giving the plostill scorned by the syrians  because of the  september israeliplo declaration of  principlesa symbolic jab       was captured by israel in  and returned to syria  in ruins following the conclusion of a disengagement of forces  agreement in       alasad uses visit for peace message      while the visitors were used as channels for extolling syrian  policies the visit also afforded damascus an opportunity to send  some signals on the peace process for foreignparticularly us  and israeliconsumption  alasad used his meeting with the  delegation as a platform for his first policy statement since the  death of his son  while breaking no new ground alasad stressed  syrias commitment to peace at times echoing his now famous  peace of the brave speech to the  druze delegation  damascus radio  september   he told the israeli arabs  we seriously seek peace and the israeli officials know this  adding in light of what they  are proposing it seems  that their vision of peace is not the same as ours  therefore  we will struggle until their peace becomes identical with our  peace     peace means rights  in other words each party has  its rights and each party is the master of itself and its  interests     when we said the peace of the brave we meant  that each party will achieve full peace with all its rights and  that neither party will humiliate the other      a limited opening to israel      the visit itself marked a symbolic though limited advance in  syrian willingness to take small steps toward opening contacts  with israel  it follows such modest advances as an evidently  officially sanctioned series of meetings outside the middle east  between syrian and israeli academics reported by israeli and  international media for example jerusalem qol yisrael   december  yediot aharonot  january  and the   visit by the druze delegation which crossed into syria directly  from the golan heights andaccording to israeli prime minister  yitzhaq rabinincluded some israeli passport holders jerusalem  qol yisrael  september  tel aviv bamahane  september   respectively  the fact that darawshah and alsani are  not only israeli citizens but also members of knesset made the  symbolism of the visit still more salient  in addition coverage  of the visit for israel radio by israeli arab correspondents who  filed a series of live dispatches from damascus was another  unprecedented event      damascus took pains to prevent the visit from appearing as a  precedent for normalization with israel but nonetheless allowed  the visits symbolism to be clearly conveyed to the syrian  public  on the one hand delegation members were forced to  travel to syria via cairo rather than directly from israel and  were barred from using israeli passports cairo mena  march  qol yisrael  march  in addition syrian mediaand even  the delegation membersavoided any explicit reference to the  groups citizenship referring to the visitors repeatedly as   palestinians  on the other hand the political status of  the delegation members was made perfectly clear on syrian media  for example darawshah was quoted by the official syrian news  service sana as saying on arrival in damascus  we represent the  palestinians in the galilee in the negev and other cities   march   moreover syrian medias airing of remarks by darawshah  even made it clear that he is a knesset member  for example  after calling in a damascus television interview for israeli  withdrawal from all the occupied territories darawshah declared  we say this from damascus and we also say the same thing in the  knesset in jerusalem      the visit also brought somewhat greater openness in syrian  medias treatment of israel as darawshah was permitted to use  syrian television to convey an unusually detailed and relatively  sympathetic portrayal of the israeli government the internal  israeli political situation and israeli public opinion  after  calling in his televised address for an israeli commitment to  withdraw from the occupied territories darawshah asserted that  of late many people in israel have begun to express stands  supportive of this formula and that their numbers are  increasing  in his  march television interview darawshah  depicted the government as interested in making further  concessions but constrained by domestic political factors  he  noted that the current israeli coalition government is supported  by the arab parties and that an expanded coalition would enable  the government to continue the peace process and to make  concessions that will respond to the true arab demands  he also  described what he said was a rational trend in israel that is  strong indeed and which believes that we must end occupation  he observed that the demonstrations staged by tens of thousands  of people in the wake of the hebron massacre was a joint  demonstration by the arab and jewish propeace forces adding  that we participated in it      although the syrian television host openly took issue with some  of darawshahs remarkssuch as the notion that there are doves  in israelthe visitors overall message was evidently agreed on  in advance as suggested by the manner in which the interviewer  appeared to pave the way for darawshahs comments  for example  he asked darawshah what is new in zionist thought and  direction      further visits      the delegations visit has prompted reports in israeli media that  there will be future visits to syria by other israeli citizens  but there have been no such reports in syrian media  evidently  based on comments by an israeli arab journalist who was part of  the delegation qol yisrael reported that foreign minister faruq  alshar had told the group the delegations visit is an opening  for additional visits to syria by israelis  march  ool  yisrael reported the same day that a delegation led by ibrahim  nimr husayn chairman of israels national committee of arab  local councils and ahmad altibi an israeli citizen and adviser  to plo chief yasir arafatmay soon leave for syria  another  qol yisrael report claimed that a  delegation of golan  druze was being permitted by israel to visit damascus to extend  condolences to alasad on his sons death but that the syrians  had not yet approved the visit  march      implications      the very fact that darawshah was given a forum for his more  favorable statements on israel suggests that syria wants the  visit to be seen as a significant indication of a genuine syrian  openness to peace with israel and as meeting israeli demands that  such openness be conveyed more clearly to the syrian public  now  that the barrier to visits by israeli arabs has been lifted  there may well be more such visits  but considering syrian  sensitivity over even the appearance of normalizing relations  with the jewish state and given syrias repeated objections to  israeli demands for a commitment to such normalization in the  future similar visits by jewish citizens of israel are probably  not imminent     author  brown  questions andor comments please call chief  near east analysis branch    cb

                          the japanese government appears to be making only slow progress  on the package of measures it is drawing up to demonstrate to the  united states that it is willing to open japanese markets and  deregulate the japanese economy  this slowness is apparently due  in part to divisions within the government over prospective parts  of the package such as increases in longterm investment and tax  cuts  infighting within the coalition government and a growing  perception that prime minister morihiro hosokawas government is  ineffective also appear to be slowing progress on the market  opening package                                       end summary     japanese government leaders continue to send signals that  progress on the package of market opening measures that tokyo is  drawing up is proceeding slowly and will not be completed by the  originally projected date at the end of march   according to the   march nihon keizai shimbun chief cabinet secretary masayoshi  takemura told a news conference on  march that a final package  of measures would not be presented to the united states until the   summit in july  although earlier reporting indicated that an  interim package might be ready by the end of march the  march  nihon keizai shimbun report did not quote takemura as saying  anything about such a package  similarly the  march mainichi  shimbun quoted minister of international trade and industry  hiroshi kumagai as telling reporters on  march that it would be  impossible to complete measures designed to deregulate the  japanese economy by the end of march  kumagai reportedly added  that it would probably take until the end of june to resolve  issues connected with the measures     one of the factors delaying progress on the package appears to be  that the government is divided over several of the most important  measures in the package  one of these measures is reportedly a  plan to increase investment under japans current  plan  for investment in public works projects by about  trillion yen  over the current  trillion yen  this plan appears to have  support from several cabinet ministers including director  general of the economic planning agency manae kubota  construction minister kozo igarashi and transport minister  shigeru ito all of whom belong to the social democratic party of  japan sdpj the largest party in the ruling coalition  according to a  march nihon keizai shimbun report kubota came  out in favor of increasing the investment plan during a  march  news conference arguing that the increase would help jump start  the sagging japanese economy  a  march kyodo report indicated  that igarashi supported kubota and advocated increasing  investment to  trillion yen  the  march yomiuri shimbun  identified ito as another supporter of the plan  in addition  japans two leading business groups the federation of economic  organizations keidanren and the japan association of corporate  executives keizai doyukai have also supported the increase  according to  march kyodo and  march nihon keizai shimbun  reports     the ministry of finance mof however reportedly opposes the  increase because there are no clear sources of revenue to finance  it  the  march yomiuri shimbun quoted minister of finance  hirohisa fujii a member of the shinseito a key party in the  ruling coalition as telling a  march news conference that  discussions of the increase including financial resources are  just beginning and there is no need to change our pace  the  paper also cited an unnamed mof official as stating that it  would be irresponsible to make a pledge to expand investment when  there is no hope of securing financial resources  according to  yomiuri shimbun mof is particularly concerned about increasing  investment in public works when reform of the tax system is still  under debate  in addition the paper reported that unnamed  officials in mof are arguing that there was no need to include an  increase in the  investment plan in the measures the  government is currently drawing up in the wake of the collapse of  usjapan trade talks because the united states has not once  asked for expansion of public investment during the framework  talks     tax reform     another contentious issue among the market opening measures is  tax reform particularly the timing and scope of proposed tax  cuts  some ministries and some bureaucrats including some  officials in the ministry of international trade and industry  miti appear to be pressing the coalition to decide quickly on  a tax reform package to include in the package of market opening  measures  an unnamed senior miti official told an asahi shimbun  reporter on  march that the ruling coalition should make a  quick decision about tax system reform and include tax reform  plans in the market opening measures asahi shimbun  march  speaking at a news conference several days later miti minister  hiroshi kumagai also reportedly pressed for a rapid decision on  tax cuts stating that the government must come up with a plan by  the end of june  the sdpj has also been widely reported to be a  strong supporter of tax cuts     here too however the mof appears to be blocking progress  the  ministry apparently continues to oppose any measures to cut taxes  unless sources of revenue other than deficit financing bonds can  be identified to offset the cuts  during a news conference on   march finance minister fujii argued that the japanese government  should not make hasty decisions about tax reform or tax cuts only  in order to include them in the package of measures designed to  address usjapan trade friction according to an  march kyodo  report     bureaucratic resistance     resistance from elsewhere within the government bureaucracy may  also be stalling work on some of the market opening measures  particularly those designed to deregulate the japanese economy  the  march asahi shimbun quoted unnamed officials in the  cabinet councilors office on internal affairs which is  reportedly charged with compiling deregulation measures as  complaining that the ministries were reluctant to draw up any  measures beyond those that they have already presented to the  hosokawa administration  similarly according to the  march  yomiuri shimbun many government ministries and agencies are  arguing that they have already implemented as many measures to  deregulate their operations as they are currently capable of  doing     coalition infighting     a fourth factor delaying progress on the market opening package  appears to be infighting within the ruling coalition government  over the handling of the package  in particular tensions  between prime minister hosokawa and shinseito secretary general  ichiro ozawa on the one hand and chief cabinet secretary takemura  on the other seem to be spilling over into the handling of the  market opening package  according to the  march asahi shimbun  takemura was charged with overseeing work on the market opening  package  however because of the tension between hosokawa and  takemura some government offices seem to have been reluctant to  work with the chief cabinet secretary  the  march asahi  shimbun reported that some ministry officials question whether he  has hosokawas confidence     tensions between ozawa and takemura and also between the  coalition and the bureaucracy may have derailed ozawas planned  trip to washington at the end of march to discuss market opening  measures  according to the  march yomiuri shimbun both ozawa  and takemura appear to have been working from different  directions to resolve bilateral trade frictions and takemura may  have seen ozawas trip as as undercutting takemuras official  role in coordinating work on the market opening package  in  addition the ministry of foreign affairs mofa appears to have  resented ozawas plans to get involved in bilateral relations  the  march nihon keizai shimbun quoted mofa and japanese  embassy officials as claiming they never heard of plans for  ozawas trip and denying that it had been approved by the  japanese government  according to the  march nihon keizai  shimbun mofa officials were miffed that they were not consulted  about the trip     outlook     the divisions within the government the resistance of parts of  the bureaucracy and infighting within the coalition will  probably not only continue to delay progress on the market  opening measures but also to limit the scope of any measures  that are ultimately drawn up  some of the steps being debated  such as tax reform involve deep longstanding divisions among  the parties in the ruling coalition that will probably be very  difficult to resolve in the near future  in order to incorporate  such steps in the market opening package without threatening the  unity of the already splintering coalition the coalition parties  will probably have to work out compromises that will water down  the measures to the point that they will have relatively little  impact  author  bounds  questions andor comments please call chief  asia division analysis team   eagbietz  cka    mar

             a lengthy statement attributed to the imprisoned shining path  leadership published recently in a leading opposition newspaper  provides what appears to be a strategic rationale for the peace  proposal made by the insurgents last fall  while the newspaper  has accepted the document as an authentic call for peace by the  shining path the paper has also stressed that the peace called  for in the statement is nothing more than a temporary tactical  retreat by the shining path leaders and is not as president  alberto fujimori has contended an implicit admission of defeat                           end summary     although la republica a prominent antifujimori daily provided  little information on the origins of the important and unusual  document that it published in a special  january supplement it  assured its readers that the lengthy ideological tract explaining  the shining paths struggle for a peace agreement was a genuine  shining path statement  the paper claimed that the anonymous  sources who supplied the secret document provided full  authentication and that experts consulted by the paper also  agreed that the document was the handiwork of imprisoned  shining path leader abimael guzman la republica   januarysee note      note  la republica did not assert that the document was  actually signed by guzman  however the paper did claim that the  document was approved by imprisoned shining path central  committee members elena iparraguirre revoredo osman morote  barrionuevo marta huatay ruiz maria pantoja sanchez and rosa  angelica salas de la cruz  january     while the antifujimori daily may have at least in part  published the document to discredit president fujimori it  contended that it was motivated by a desire to provide peruvians  with information on the peace proposal that had not been made  available by the government  the paper declared that it was  clearly its duty to publish the document given the mantle of  silence that the government has cast over the peace negotiations   january     la republicas publication of the shining path strategy statement  follows by three months the october  release by the fujimori  government

letters really represented authoritative shining path policy see  boxsee note      note  among other objectives the narrowly successful  referendum was designed to allow the president to serve a second  successive term     tactical retreat for guzman     implicitly rejecting fujimoris claim that the shining paths  call for a negotiated peace represented an admission of political  defeat by the insurgents la republica concluded that the  movements leadership saw its call for peace as nothing more than  a temporary ceasefire  januarysee note   according to  the dailys  january editorial the shining path tract makes  it clear that in the eyes of abimael guzman a peace agreement  is simply an armed truce until after the year  at which  time the shining path would resume its bloodbath  la republica  offered a possible explanation for the insurgents tactical  retreat in a  january interview with a military and subversion  analyst who suggestedthat a temporary withdrawal may offer  guzman an opportunity to preserve his authority as political  leader despite the obvious limitations of beings imprisoned  thee  analyst concluded therefore that the insurgents peace strategy  represents an ideological reaffirmation of guzmans leadership  and recognition that circumstances have changed     note  for example in his presentation of the video recording  of guzmans first call for peace talks fujimori claimed that the  shining path political leadership has tacitly admitted that  the peruvian state has totally recovered the initiative in  confronting the shining path lima radio and tv  october       outlook     la republicas assessment of the shining path peace strategy  document may quiet doubts about whether earlier letters calling  for peace talks actually represented the views of top leaders  at the same time however by concluding that the published  strategy statement is merely the shining paths declaration of  temporary retreat the daily has raised new questions about the  credibility of fujimoris claim that the call for peace  represents a victory for the government  while such doubts are  unlikely to seriously affect fujimoris prospects for reelection  next year they may have further tarnished the image of the  peruvian president already damaged by his narrow victory in the  constitutional referendum last october     box     media doubts over earlier shining path peace letters      following the first guzman letter calling for peace talks  announced by fujimori at thee united nations last october radio  programas del peru  october  the conservative daily el  comercio reported that one seasoned political observer had  warned that guzmans reported desire to reach a peace  agreement does not mean there is reason to claim a victory in  the ongoing struggle against terrorism since according to the  observer the imprisoned insurgent leader may no longer control  the shining path  october       following the second guzman letter which supplemented the  call for peace talks with what seemed to be praise for fujimoris  economic and political program lima global de television   october  a commentator for the antifujimori weekly

the  days prior to the  october vote  october        responding similarly to the second guzman letter an editorial  in la republica wondered whether government representatives  working to promote the yes vote on the referendum had not  fallen into a trap by thinking that shining path militants  would take seriously such an unctuous call for peace talks as  appeared in the letter  october       also in response to the second letter caretas on  october  claimed that fujimori was using guzman in the campaign to win  the  october referendum noting that with guzmans letters  calling for peace

   summary                                          russian foreign minister andrey kozyrev hailed the results of his  meeting with us secretary of state warren christopher as  indicating that the usrussian partnership is able to surmount  recent strains and continue to develop  kozyrevs reaction  contrasted with his recent statements on the bilateral  relationship in which he suggested that russia was being  relegated to a subordinate role illsuited to its capabilities  and national interests                                       end summary     kozyrev gave an upbeat assessment of the state of usrussian  relations following his  march meeting with secretary  christopher in vladivostok  he expressed satisfaction with the  results of the meeting emphasizing that the two countries acted  as equals during discussions on a broad range of international  issues  dismissing the recent strains in the relationship  kozyrev asserted that we are partners and we will continue to  work in this direction itartass  march  he told reporters  that circles in both russia and the united states object to the  mature and strategic nature of the bilateral relationship and  that all sorts of hiccups and problems like expresident  richard nixons protocol difficulties or spy fever are bound  to occur but we are too serious to give into them interfax   march     previous concerns     prior to the meeting kozyrev had expressed concerns about the  state of usrussian relations and suggested that adjustments to  the partnership needed to be made      on the eve of his departure from moscow for vladivostok he  told reporters that the aim of the meeting would be to develop  the partnership on a new basis stressing that there could be  no question of a junior orsenior partner or more freedom  for one to the detriment of the other  rejecting suggestions  that relations had begun to cool he noted that there can be  differing interests within the partnership moscow radio   march      similarly in a  march television interview he said that he  and christopher would discuss what form of partnership the two  countries should have stressing that we should agree on this so  it does not cause annoyance or come as a surprise when russia  comes out with its own initiative  noting that russia feels  offended when us officials launch an initiative that the two  countries should have agreed upon together kozyrev said that  such differences needed to be clarified and a mechanism for  interaction should be finalized moscow tv  march      in an article on usrussian relations published in izvestiya  on  march he also called for adjustments in the relationship  while at the same time stressing that there is no reasonable  alternative to partnership which he implied is essential to  shape a democratic russia and transform the unstable post  communist world into a lasting democratic one  he claimed that  russian and us national interests concerning the main world  problems not only do not conflict but complement each other  he stressed however that certain illusions such as a western  view that if the russians are good they must follow us in  everything or a russian view that partnership is an idyllic  situation without conflicts and problems must be abandoned  he  contended that partnership based on common values and  sympathies does not mean renouncing competition and disputes  or a firm or aggressive policy of upholding your own national  interests  he cautioned moreover that agreeing to play a  subordinate role would be as unwarranted as it is politically  dangerous for russia in view of the extreme nationalist and  reactionary domesticj forces who would immediately take  advantage of such a stance  warning that exponents of gloomy  selffulfilling prophecies would exploit usrussian disputes  if they continue he called upon the two countries to develop a  strategy and instruments for partnership and particularly a  mechanism for coordinating their actions on international  problems     media concerns about relationship     russia media commentary on the vladivostok meeting has so far  been sparse but its thrust has been to dismiss the upbeat  official assessments of the meeting and continue to focus on  problems facing the relationship  a  march commentary in the  reformist newspaper kommersantdaily dismissed the official line  that the meeting plastered over the cracks in the relationship  asserting that despite the upbeat tone of the joint statement  more cracks may develop soon  commenting on russias new  involvement in the middle east the article noted that us  actions in the region were emphatically independent from moscow  and warned that there is an obvious rivalry in middle east  peacemaking between moscow and washington  in a  march  article in the reformist newspaper segodnya a commentator  chiding the incompetence of both us and russian officials  contended that the russian foreign ministry by displaying the  most intense activity possible had created a legend about  stunning foreign policy successes that could trigger us ideas  about containment  the commentator said that washington  appeared ready to go to any lengths to prevent a return to a  global nuclear standoff but warned that the stabilization in  bilateral relations proclaimed at vladivostok may be  shortlived     before the meeting russian media commentators had speculated  about whether or how badly usrussian relations had been  damaged in the wake of controversy over bosnia the ames spy  case the nixon visit and other differences  some commentators  echoing kozyrev tried to minimize any coolness or weakening in  the partnership while others ignoring the vladivostok meeting  contended that the united states had already changed its policy  toward russia      echoing the government line moscow radio commentaries on   march played down any differences  commentator yuriy solton said  secretary christopher had refuted reports that washington was  dissatisfied with moscows active policy in yugoslavia noting  that he had said the united states welcomed russias initiatives  in bosnia and elsewhere  solton stressed that statements that  usrussian relations had become more strained or in poor  condition were absolutely groundless  admitting that each  country wants to pursue its own end solton emphasized that  moscow and washington were doing this in close cooperation with  each other and without any of the rivalry of the cold war  contending that both moscow and washington saw their main task as  consistently improving their relationship solton said this task  would define the atmosphere at vladivostok  likewise  commentator valentin zorin dismissing the recent disputes as  occurring in a period marked by the loss of illusions on both  sides stressed that global confrontation between the two  countries is a thing of the past and that what unites them is  so much more important that frictions that may emerge      in contrast a  march article in the masscirculation  newspaper komsomolskaya pravda took issue with secretary  christophers reported statement that russia could not act  unilaterally in responding to appeals for military assistance  from countries of the former soviet union but could only respond  under the auspices of the united nations or other international  organizations  the article also alleged that the secretary had  commented on russian president boris yeltsins  february  speech which had spoken of russias right to act to ensure  stability and protect russians in the near abroad with some  scorn  contending that the warnings from washington were an  attempt to keep russia in the inferior state to which it had been  reduced in recent years often by the shortsightedness of   diplomats and to guarantee washingtons  superpowerdom the article advised kozyrev to have a serious  talk about this with secretary christopher in vladivostok      a  march article by prominent foreign affairs commentator  aleksandr golts in the defense ministrys newspaper krasnaya  zvezda titled the chill must not develop into confrontation  warned that conflicts and microcrises in usrussian relations  had been following each other virtually without interruption and  in everincreasing intensity  criticizing washington for among  other things intensifying us involvement in cis affairs in  order to prevent the revival of a dreaded russian empire golts  charged that such an approach not only was inappropriate for  states that only yesterday were calling themselves allies but  went beyond the bounds of common sense and could scuttle  efforts to settle conflicts  taking issuewith secretary  christophers remarks on russian peacekeeping efforts golts  asked with evident sarcasm if the united states allowed its own  freedom of action to be restricted anywhere at all by  consultations with international organizations  golts contended  that russias active involvement in trying to end conflicts both  in the former soviet republics and elsewhere was important not  only because moscow was offering sensible ways to end the  suffering of thousands but also because it strengthened  russias selfesteem by demonstrating that russia was a state  that could resolve global problems  while asserting that us  russian differences were not insoluble golts warned that  neither russia nor the united states can afford the luxury of a  new confrontation while they search for a new model of mutual  relations and he called upon both states to use the vladivostok  meeting to prevent undesirable developments      a  march article in the proyeltsin newspaper izvestiya  headlined that usrussian relations are experiencing the most  serious crisis of recent years  in describing the reasons for  the time of coolness the article supported moscows proper  response to the nixon visit and diplomatic activism in the  balkans the middle east and the near abroad but fretted over  how washington might react to such policy changes  for  example the article cited a western diplomat as complaining  that after the reformers poor showing in the december  parliamentary elections the yeltsin administration adopted the  slogans of the opposition adding it was difficult to know who  was making foreign policy pronouncementskozyrev or communist  leader gennadiy zyuganov  ending on an optimistic note the  article reported that the russian foreign ministry would strive  to avoid confrontation with washington at vladivostok and quoted  an informed ministry source as saying there are no major  reasons for exacerbating usrussian relations      ignoring the upcoming meeting entirely in a  march article  in procommunist newspaper pravda commentator vladislav drobkov  reported on what he called washingtons change of direction and  campaign to reevalute relations with russia and develop ties  with other countries of the former soviet union  claiming that  all his washington interlocutors had invariably said that  coolness had set in between moscow and washington drobkov  backed up his argument by quoting alleged statements about russia  by us officials  for example he quoted senator richard lugar  as saying  is not russias partner we are  bitter rivals     implications     kozyrevs efforts to play down any substantive differences with  washington probably reflect moscows determination to keep  bilateral relations on track but his emphasis on achieving  equality in the relationship indicates an equally strong  determination that russia not be relegated to what russians would  view as an inferior role  the medias continuing preoccupation  with the differences and disputes between washington and moscow  suggests an ongoing tension between pride that russia is resuming  what is perceived as its rightful role as a global power and  concern that a confrontation with washington

government appears to be interpreting portions of  the  march agreement to expand motorolas access to the  japanese cellular phone market in ways that differ significantly  from the reported us

various us officials on the  march cellular telephone  agreement  these differences with us officials  interpretations focus on language that commits the japanese  government to ensuring that the japanese telecommunications  company nippon idou tsushin ido carries out its pledges to  increase market access for the us firm motorola      according to the  march nihon keizai shimbun when the  agreement was announced on  march vice minister of posts and  telecommunications takenori kanzaki specifically denied that the  japanese government had accepted any sort of numerical targets       the  march nihon keizai shimbun also reported that ministry  of posts and telecommunications mpt general affairs councillor  masahito tani on  march took issue with comments reportedly  made by us trade representative mickey kantor that the  agreement represented a victory for the us governments  resultsoriented policy in dealing with usjapan trade issues  tani reportedly said that in the japanese governments view  idos commitment to increase the number of base stations capable  of handling motorola equipment was neither a numerical target  nor an objective criterion  it is nothing but a private  corporations contract      according to the  march nihon keizai shimbun vice minister  of foreign affairs kunihiko saito attempted to play down a clause  in the agreement between the us and japanese governments which  states that tokyo will use all available measures to ensure  that ido fulfills the agreement  the paper quoted saito as  stating that all this means is something like conducting regular  checks on the degree of progress being made in dealings between  the private companies  saito also reportedly told kyodo on   march that the japanese government was in no position to  intervene in the affairs of private companies and asserted that  any difference in the us and japanese interpretation of the  agreement was because of washingtons misunderstanding of the  accord      similarly vice minister of posts and telecommunications  futoshi shirai in comments to kyodo on  march took issue with  reported remarks by us officials stating that the japanese  government had in no way agreed to guarantee that ido would meet  the target of building  base stations using motorola  technology as stipulated in the cellular phone agreement      an unidentified senior ministry of international trade and  industry miti official reportedly told kyodo on  march that  the japanese government had provided no guarantee that ido would  fulfill its commitments     concern over precedent     one of the major reasons for the japanese governments efforts to  limit the way in which the cellular phone agreement is  interpreted appears to be a concern that the united states will  attempt to use the agreement as a model for setting numerical  targets for market opening measures in other sectors  a  march  kyodo report quoted an unidentified senior miti official as  stating that japan could not accept any interpretation of the  agreement that would lead to the setting of numerical targets  according to the  march nihon keizai shimbun miti is  particularly worried that the united states might try to use the  model of the cellular telephone agreement in the auto sector  asking japanese government to provide guarantees for voluntary  targets for imports of usmade automobiles and auto parts that  japanese automobile companies are reportedly currently drawing  up  in a  march speech miti vice minister for international  affairs sozaburo okamatsu reportedly specifically stated that the  cellular telephone agreement could not be applied to the  automobile sector  according to a  march kyodo report  okamatsu stated that while the telecommunications sector was  regulated by government licenses the auto and auto parts  industries were completely free trade areas which could not be  controlled by the government     the cancellation of a planned visit to washington by ichiro  ozawa secretary general of one of the key parties in the ruling  coalition and the japanese politician widely reported to have  been instrumental in framing the cellular phone accord may also  reflect the japanese governments desire to limit the impact of  the cellular phone agreement  the  march yomiuri shimbun  quoted senior members of ozawas party and other japanese  officials as stating that the united states pinned too high hopes  on ozawa expecting that he would come to washington with a bag  packed with a lot of gifts     outlook     japanese officials will probably do everything possible to keep  the cellular telephone pact from serving as a precedent for the  setting of numerical targets in other sectors  the difference in  interpretation with the united states however has the potential  to create further friction in bilateral relations  in the past  tokyo has differed with the united states over the wording of  such agreements as the  usjapan semiconductor agreement  and the agreement setting up the usjapan framework talks  reached by former prime minister kiichi miyazawa and president  clinton in july   in the semiconductor agreement tokyo has  consistently argued that the united states has misinterpreted a  pledge that the foreign share of the japanese semiconductor  market would reach  percent by the fourth quarter of  as a  formal commitment when the japanese government intended it only  as a goal  similarly in the framework agreement the japanese  government has consistently disagreed with the united states over  how to define the objective criteria which the agreement stated  would be established to measure japans trade performance  author  bounds  questions andor comments please call chief  asia divsion analysis

 march     in contrast german economics minister guenter rexrodts  opposition to us trade measures has been very muted  he told  an interviewer on  february that he opposed numerical targets  because

japanese that they need to restructure  their society and their business structures  germany would  discuss every measure and every pressure on the japanese  insisting that they must not just bow and promise but must also  make commitments he said  nevertheless he added numerical  targets were clearly against gatt and free trade reuter   february     french media reaction     french media reaction reflected concern that us trade measures  could also be aimed at europe but media commentary also indicated  some sympathy for and even approval of us pressure on japan     the influential liberation of  march said president clinton  had pulled out the heaviest weapon from his arsenal super   following pressure from industrial lobbies and congress to  force the japanese to reduce their trade surplus  it also noted  that while eu countries are publicly criticizing the unilateral  us approach some leaders in private understand the american  anger     the business daily les echos of  march

it would serve as a warning shot to  japan without opening excessive hostilities     german media reaction     although the leading german press criticized us reinstatement  of super  as being contrary to the spirit of gatt and as a  possible threat to european trade with japan some papers also  expressed sympathy for the us moves to break down japanese  trade barriers     the influential german daily frankfurter allgemeine called us  concern about the horrendous japanese trade surpluses  understandable but said that minimum import quotas are a bad  relapse into stateregulated foreign trade  march  it is  clear and natural the daily said  that washington is urging  the japanese to remove their barriers to import competition but  the united states is trying to forcibly clear a path for us  firms and manipulate trade taking measures that ignore gatt  principles  march     the business daily handelsblatt noted that us patience was  apparently exhausted because of the lack of progress in  reducing japanese trade surpluses  nevertheless it called such  unilateral measures incompatible with the complexities of  world trade saying that the dangerous aspect is that super   can

crisisking  husayns religious pilgrimage to mecca and medina on  march  yielded a sharp rebuff when king fahd pointedly failed to receive  husayn and his toplevel delegation  indicating official  jordanian embarrassment over the saudi snub subsequent jordanian  media treatment of the visit suggests an effort to limit the  political fallout by putting the best face possible on the visit                              end summary      although king husayn officially traveled to saudi arabia to  perform the umra or minor pilgrimage he evidently hoped to  effect a public reconciliation with fahd and overcome saudi anger  over husayns alleged sympathy for iraq during the gulf crisis  indicative of the trips political dimension a large delegation  accompanied the king on his first visit to saudi arabia following  a fouryear hiatus in addition to princes abdallah talal and  ghazi the prime minister the chief of the royal court the  kings adviser the chief chamberlain and the kings private  secretary the delegation included the chairman of the joint  chiefs of staff and a number of top state and military  officials amman radio  march     moreover in the months prior to king husayns arrival in saudi  arabia on  march the jordanian leadership made many flattering  and conciliatory references to saudi arabia revealing ammans  strong desire for a rapid reconciliation and laying the  groundwork for the kings visit     during a news conference in washington in january the king  said he hoped ammanriyadh relations would return to their  warmth  although he has always stopped short of an official  public apology for jordans refusal to join the international  coalition against iraqsomething riyadh evidently expects as a  condition for restoring tieshusayn said that he hoped our  brethren in saudi arabia will realize that we never meant them  any harm nor did we cause them any harm at all amman tv   january     in a departure from previous jordanian criticism of

reports on husayns  pilgrimage broadcast by jordans staterun radio and television  refrained from discussing the political potential of the visit  focusing instead on factual accounts of the kings religious  activities  however articles appearing in the semiindependent  press during the kings pilgrimage undoubtedly fueled speculation  about a saudijordanian reconciliation     a column in the daily sawt alshab indicated optimistic  expectations stating that there is no denying we entertain high  hopes for a reconciliation and that we fervently hope to see  amman and riyadh embrace in a long hug after a long  estrangement   the column also suggested that arabs would  suffer further ignominy humiliation and division without  moves toward reconciliation  march     on the day of king husayns departure for jeddah the weekly  alahd organ of the conservative alahd political party  speculated about the meetings that will be held during the  kings visit adding that jordanian nationalists had hope and  confidence in our ability to put the gulf crisis behind us  the  article underscored the big role the saudi brothers can play in  giving arabisraeli peace negotiations added impetus  march     an editorial in the daily alray on  marchevidently  published prior to the news that fahd did not meet husayn  optimistically opined that the kings minor pilgrimage would not  be limited to the religious aspect in terms of its importance  and anticipated that the jordanian and saudi brothers would  find the right moment to meet settle differences and reaffirm  that they have absorbed the lessons of past stages and the  dangers of each upcoming stage      damage control      smarting from the saudi snub and sensitive to possible public  disappointment the jordanian government has not been observed to  comment officially on the trip  media reports on the visit have  been meager although this was partially because of the non  publication of most jordanian newspapers over the id alfitr  holiday  those reports that disclosed official disappointment  with the trip cited only unnamed government sources while other  articles evidently sought to mask the negative outcome by playing  up the religious nature of the kings sojourn  still other  reports claimed favorable results from the trip giving king  husayn credit for his initiative and indicating that the ball was  now in the saudi court     the englishlanguage daily jordan times cited a source close  to the palace as expressing disappointment that the king was  reaching out in reconciliation but king fahd did not respond  although there was no monitored official confirmation of a  planned fahdhusayn meeting the times cited official sources as  having told the paper privately that the two kings had been  slated to meet on  march for the first time since the outbreak  of the gulf crisis  another anonymous wellplaced source cited  by the times said the king was aware his trip to saudi arabia  would be a purely spiritual visit  nonetheless the same  official credited the king with having broken a psychological  barrier with saudi arabia by making the trip after four years of  staying away  march     the weekly akhbar alusbu published an unsigned article  playing down the disappointing outcome of husayns visit and  giving the king credit for his effort  jordan it said had  chosen to rise above the panarab wounds to heal the rift which  afflicted the arab homeland after the gulf war for the sake of  restoring arab solidarity and reactivating joint arab action that  can confront the serious challenges threatening the arab and  islamic nation  the kings gesture it noted was not new  but stemmed from the continuous role the hashemites have played  in unifying the arabs and muslims throughout the ages   march      saudi media response      in line with the governments silence official saudi media were  not observed to report or comment on king husayns arrival  pilgrimage activities or departure  domestic saudi newspapers  were similarly observed to contain no mention of the kings  visit  curiously two londonbased saudiowned paperswhich  exercise somewhat more editorial flexibility than their domestic  counterpartsevidently anticipated that a fahdhusayn meeting  would occur perhaps influenced by speculation on the matter  within the diplomatic community  alsharq alawsat on  march  quoted king husayns alleged personal apologies to king fahd  for their adversarial gulf war relationship  while alhayah on   march actually reported that king fahd had received the  jordanian monarch the previous evening in holy mecca      implications      the public optimism regarding hopes for a reconciliation with  saudi arabia appears to have embarrassed the government in the  wake of the kings return to jordan without having met with king  fahd  although prospects for a reconciliation were never  officially confirmed the widespread media speculation clearly  indicated that a fahdhusayn meeting had been expected by the  governmentparticularly since fahd had received former gulf war  adversary plo chairman arafat during the latters minor  pilgrimage in january  nevertheless fahds decision not to  receive husayn as well as the complete silence of saudi arabias  official media suggest that saudi arabia will expect further  measuressuch as a more explicit public expression of jordanian  contrition for its stance during the gulf warif the  longstanding impasse is to be broken  following this episode  any further attempts by king husayn to mend fences with saudi  arabia will likely be through private and diplomatic channels  and will carry a low media profileat least until the prospects  for success are guaranteed by

with the iaea on resolution of the  nuclear inspection issue an effort apparently motivated by  concern over the need to salvage highlevel talks with washington  and head off possible un sanctions

statement seemed to  carefully avoid foreclosing the possibility of a negotiated  settlement pyongyang radio  march  although the statement  carried the standard warning against applying pressure on  pyongyang and charges of western plans to crush the dprk its  major complaint seemed to be that the iaea is convening a board  of governors meetingreportedly for  march yonhap  march  even before analyzing the results of the just concluded  inspections having hastily reached the unjust conclusion  that it cannot guarantee nondiversion of nuclear materials     note the department was previously known as the ministry of  atomic energy industry  pyongyang media have not been observed  to report on the apparent reorganization     the statement which made it clear that pyongyang had allowed the  iaea inspection this time solely to facilitate dprkus high  level talkssee note noted areas of basic disagreement with the  iaea  this disagreement is due the statement claimed to the  inspection teams attempts to go beyond the contents of a   march bilateral agreement reached in vienna with the iaea  according to pyongyang      the iaea inspection team unfairly maintained that the  inspections were being conducted under nuclear nonproliferation  treaty npt safeguards  the north korean statement claimed that  pyongyang had agreed only to allow inspections purely to ensure  continuity of the safeguards reiterating pyongyangs contention  that its special status of having only temporarily suspended  withdrawal from the npt exempts it from normal safeguards  obligations      the iaeas insistence on  extracting samples in sealedoff  areas where the seals remained intact  gamma radiation mapping  at all points instead of selected points and  examining the  cooling system  went beyond what is needed to merely ensure  continuity of the safeguards  such inspections the statement  maintained would have made the inspections equivalent to  routine and ad hoc inspections required under the safeguards     note underscoring pyongyangs eagerness to resume highlevel  bilateral talks with washington north korean ambassador to  moscow son songpil has reiterated pyongyangs contention that  the dprkus talks once held will serve as an important  occasion to solve the nuclear issue and will also lead to easy  resolution of pending interkorean issues pyongyang radio   march     charges of pressure tactics     the statement complained that  the iaea had sent three messages to pyongyang during the  inspection threatening to report to the board of governors  that the agency is not in a position to verify nondiversion of  nuclear materials unless its demands were met  however in  warning against such pressure tactics the north korean  statement said that any attempts at pressuring the dprk would  lead to a situation in which we would have no choice but to take  a decisive measure to counter them  the statement went on to  pledge that pyongyang will watch to see if the iaea intends to  resolve our nuclear issue fairly or attempts to use it for  political aimsa relatively circumspect formulation that would  appear to allow pyongyang a certain range of latitude in judging  iaea action on the inspection issue     implications     although the statement seemed to leave little  room for compromise it did stop short of an ultimatum adopting  instead a waitandsee attitude toward future iaea action  these  caveats suggests that pyongyang is trying to protect the  possibility of engaging in bilateral talks with washington by  somehow preventing referral of the

a rift in the  coalition that liberated kuwait president saddam husayn has  presented the un security council with a virtual ultimatum  threatening implicitly that if it fails to take significant steps in  coming weeks toward lifting the sanctions iraq may cease to  cooperate with the un special commission and adopt a confrontational  posture  coming amid signs that the sanctions are causing  increasing economic difficulties in iraq saddams move reflects his  impatience with the security councils failure to lift the sanctions  in response to baghdads diplomacy and selective compliance his  desire to frustrate effective future monitoring of iraqi weapons  programs and his unwillingness to make further concessions in  compliance with un resolutions  such as recognizing the border  with kuwait                         end summary     in a  march speech which iraqi media played up as an ultimatum  threatening confrontation if a date for lifting the sanctions is not  set saddam demanded that the security council implement paragraph   of resolution   allowing iraq to resume its oil sales   immediately and without any conditions  he warned that if deputy  prime minister tariq aziz returns from the un security council  session without the councils agreement to activate paragraph   then iraqs people and leadership would have no choice but to  decide what they believe will give them hope    in the direction  they believe is sound baghdad radio     media highlight speech     tightly controlled iraqi media immediately began to portray  saddams speech as an ultimatum and to prepare the iraqi public for  confrontation  for example      the daily babil owned by saddams son udayy said that  saddams speech defined the contents of the decisive iraqi  confrontation with the enemies iraqi news agency   march      the daily alqadisiyah see note  claimed saddams speech  gave the security council the last chance    to lift the  sanctions without delay or conditions ina  march     note  around midseptember  alqadisiyah was removed  from the supervision of the defense ministry and affiliated with the  information ministry which now controls this paper as well as al  jumhuriyah aliraq  september   probably more than an  economy measure this change made by a revolution command council  decree may have been designed to limit the political power of the  defense ministry      interpreting saddams speech as threatening an end to or  reduction in iraqi cooperation with the united nations the bath  party daily althawrah said that if the security council does not  lift the sanctions iraq will choose a new road different    in  terms of its approach to  resolutions and committees a road  that will prove iraq has other options aside from cooperating with  colonialist interpretations of un resolutions ina  march     earlier signs     saddam had already foreshadowed a possible change of policy in  his  january gulf war anniversary speech in which he pledged that  we will not relinquish our people in the northern part of the  homeland nor will we stand idle toward the continuation of the  blockade and the violation of our sovereignty in southern iraq  in  that speech he also warned all evildoers masters and satellites   and especially some evildoers from saudi arabia and kuwait   not to miscalculate because the punishment of the criminals is an  eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth baghdad radio     explaining the shift     in his  march speech saddam explained that a shift from  diplomacy to confrontation may prove necessary because iraqis who  advocated concessions seem to have been wrong while iraqi hardliners  seem to have been right  he said iraq had thus far employed  diplomatic efforts to achieve a better level of understanding by  the security council because many people in our country had  expected that this policy would make some people whose hearts  have no feeling show a flexible position and open the doors again  to the iraqi people     saddam contrasted iraqis who favored the diplomatic policy with  other iraqis who were quite convinced that the criminal level of  aggression and the way sanctions were implemented    came from  minds without any conscience  he said these iraqis evidently now  including himself believed that despite iraqs offers and  responses its diplomats would discover that there is nothing  being given in return and that the security councils paragraph   is being used merely as a tactical cover to make iraq fulfill its  obligations while the security council fails to fulfill its own  obligations     minimum demands     indicating his minimum demands saddam castigated un special  commission chairman rolf ekeus for failing to provide a timetable  stating when the probationary period for monitoring iraqi weapons  production would begin and end  saddam insisted that the iraqis  must know when they can start selling oil so that they will be able  to make their plans see what they can do and prepare themselves  psychologically and economically for the required duration     saddam also revealed his resentment that ekeus was working to  turn un security council resolution  into an effective monitoring  instrument  he claimed ekeus had said that as soon as iraq approved  of  he would write a report to the security council but when  iraq approved it ekeus said in saddams words we must first  start monitoring and make sure that iraq is implementing  the way  we want  the way ekeus wants   in order to make sure iraq is  committed  saddam claimed that the probationary monitoring period  should have started as soon as the two cameras to monitor missile  testing were installed and turned on     aziz letter     in a letter to the un security council president on  march  aziz reiterated that iraq demands that the council apply  paragraph  immediately and without any additional restrictions or  conditions and that it reject the tendentious political  interpretations of its resolutions that some states are seeking to  impose on the council  rejection of iraqs demand he said would  certainly lead to a reassessment of the situation and to an action   that will protect the iraqi people from the harm to which  they are being exposed     indicating that at least for now iraq will not recognize kuwait  and the iraqkuwait boundary as required by un security council  resolution  aziz said that if the sanctions and the nofly  zones are lifted the issue of kuwait could then be discussed in  accordance with the rules regulating relations among states  baghdad radio  march see box      perceived rift     baghdad appears to believe that now is an opportune moment to  exploit what it perceives as a serious rift within the alliance that  liberated kuwait  for example the information ministrys  mouthpiece aljumhuriyah has claimed that the united states has  become virtually isolated in its calls for the continued  enforcement of sanctions against iraq particularly since it has  seen with its own eyes the disintegration of its international  coalition ina  march  iraqi media have recently listed france  russia and china as among the countries showing understanding for  baghdads position  in a recent article saddams press secretary  abdaljabbar muhsin advocated using a policy of intimidation and  temptation denying trade benefits priority in debt payments and  other benefits to any country not currently adopting a just and  equitable stand and offering corresponding benefits to countries  now helping iraq to lift the sanctions babil  february     information ministry first under secretary nuri najm almarsumi  argued in aliraq  the daily of the prosaddam kurds  that  iraqi diplomacy and us mistakes had helped create a serious  fissure within the antiiraq alliance and that current  international and regional circumstances provide iraq with a  serious and true opportunity for lifting the unfair embargo  therefore he said iraq must draw the worlds attention to its  determination and capability not to remain idle if the sanctions  continue and to its current rallying around saddam to thwart the  aggression once and for all and to achieve the decisive victory   march see box      implications     saddam clearly is unwilling to recognize kuwait as required by  un security council resolution  unable to stay in power without  repressing his people as required by resolution  and surprised  by ekeus determination to treat resolution  as an effective  means of monitoring iraqi weapons  nevertheless he seems to  believe that to protect his proclaimed status as iraqs historic  leader and to avoid being perceived as weak he needs to manipulate  the security council into setting a date for iraq to resume selling  its oil  he is therefore hoping that his threat to adopt a new  presumably more confrontational policy will break up the usled  coalition and erode the sanctions     if his ultimatum is rejected saddam will almost certainly feel  compelled to do something to carry out his threat  he may be  content with an intensified propaganda campaign directed in  particular to arab and islamic countries and with repeatedly  threatening and then carrying out a gradual reduction or sudden  cessation in iraqs present degree of cooperation with the united  nations  however one cannot rule out saddams giving up on efforts  to lift sanctions and therefore seeking a victory in another area  such as a move to regain control of iraqi kurdistan                   box   denying kuwaiti legitimacy     saddams consideration of a change of policy is based partly on  his unwillingness to go any further to comply with un resolutions  for example iraqi leaders and media have signaled their continuing  intention not to recognize the legitimacy of kuwait its government  or its border with iraq      in an address to prosaddam foreign visitors on  january  saddam personally denied the legitimacy of the kuwaiti rulers  claiming that by their own actions they had lost the right to rule  after accusing them of lying in  in order to make the us  public accept the idea of war against iraq he said that when a  muslim ruler lies then he has lost every legitimate right to be a  ruler ina      commenting on saddams statement in his  january gulf war  anniversary speech that we will not turn wisdom into a prelude for  weakness and despair information ministry first under secretary  almarsumi explained that while wisdom and necessity have led  iraq  to accept un security council resolutions iraq will not simply  agree to whatever it is asked for  in particular it will not  guarantee the security of the bandits the rulers of the kuwait  governorate and saudi arabia despite the fact that this is what  the americans want babil  january      the practice of referring to kuwait as the   governorate of kuwait has continued for example aljumhuriyah  editor salah almukhtar in an article in babil  january babil   and  february  more recently saddams press secretary abd  aljabbar muhsin has repeatedly referred to kuwait as kazimah the  iraqiimposed name for kuwait city under the occupation babil   march                     end of box                  box  economic deterioration     official efforts to prepare the public for a change in policy  have come amid signs of increasing economic deterioration that  baghdad perceives as a threat to iraqi steadfastness and morale  for example       a babil editorial under a pseudonym used by saddams son  udayy castigated the cabinet for decisions that allegedly caused  the dinars exchange rate to plummet between september  and  january  thereby allowing iraqs enemy to make some gains in  the arena of the economic battle  the editorial citing a un  statement that called for deferring any discussion of lifting the  embargo until iraqs good will had been tested for a year implied  that iraq could not last another year unless the dinars slide is  reversed  it therefore suggested that the success or failure of a  ministry should be judged by its contribution to the strength or  weakness of the dinar  january      saddams press secretary abdaljabbar muhsin attacked a  handful of misled iraqis who raise prices whenever the enemy  escalates its onslaught and its conspiracies and who have become a  danger to iraqi morale and steadfastness alqadisiyah   february      the  budget and investment plan was  percent below the   figures baghdad radio  december                       end of box

threatens npt withdrawal calls for us talks    pyongyangs threat to withdraw from the npt came in an  authoritative foreign ministry spokesmans statement issued on   march pyongyang radio  march  in the statement pyongyang  said it will carry into practice its declaration of npt  withdrawal announced on  march  under certain conditions    if the united states refuses bilateral talks with north korea  and resumes team spirit thereby increasing its nuclear threat  against the dprk    if the iaea further expands it unfairness by distorting the  results of its recent inspections in north korea and resorts to  forcible measures and pressures   the  march statement which for the first time acknowledged  that the dprkus talks scheduled for the same day in geneva did  not take place also repeated familiar north korean charges of  us violations of previous agreements with north korea and  declared that pyongyang will no longer be dutybound to ensure  continuity of npt safeguards   hint of moderation     possibly seeking to soften its threatand  thus somehow leave the door ajar for dialogue with washington  the statement seemed to imply that as long as there is any hope  of resuming bilateral talks with washington pyongyang may  refrain from taking the final step of npt withdrawal  north  korean withdrawal from the npt the statement said would occur  only if the united states persists in avoiding bilateral talks  to the end  underscoring pyongyangs reluctance to  definitively rule out future talks the statement asserted that  the dprk is in no hurry at allpresumably to foreclose  avenues of dialogue with washingtoneven if the dprkus talks  are not held  in addition in contrast to north korean  pronouncements on the interkorean talks see following article  the statement like previous pronouncements on washingtons  policy refrained from extreme polemical attacks on washington   pyongyang media also appeared to react with similar  circumspection to recent

exporting weapons of mass  destruction is supporting terrorism and may already possess  nuclear weapons yonhap  march   implications     pyongyang clearly prefers to deal only with  washington on the

off talks with seoul threatens war                                summary   accusing seoul of engaging in pressure tactics pyongyang has  abruptly broken off bilateral talks and issued threats of war  threats that it subsequently appeared to moderate  north korea  apparently hopes to gain from what it sees as differences within  the rok government and between seoul and washington on the  nuclear issue                               end summary   the north came to panmunjom on  march clearly prepared to break  off the ongoing negotiations with the south on the exchange of  presidential envoys  the north korean chief delegateidentified  in seoul media as pak yongsunot only reinstated demands that  he had previously indicated would be retracted but also insisted  that the rok government apologize to all koreansa formulation  pyongyang had typically used in the past to signal its  noninterest in dialogue with seoul and tokyothis time for  allegedly obstructing dprkus highlevel talks pyongyang  radio  march   the norths main complaint against the south focused on what pak  described as seouls sudden change of attitude toward adoption  of tough measures against pyongyang  in particular pak said  that north koreas pique was based on reports of the  march  highlevel strategic meeting in seoul which had reportedly  discussed holding team spirit the deployment of patriot  missiles and international sanctions  pak equated this alleged  change in the souths attitude to a grave crime and claimed  that it necessitated the reimposition of the four demands made  earlier by the northdemands that pak had previously admitted  were barriers to envoy exchanges erected by pyongyang itself  the north had demanded that the south refrain from  staging  largescale nuclear exercises  introducing new weapons  including the patriot missile and  using threats of  international sanctions  the north had also demanded previously  that  the south retract rok president kim yongnams remarks  about not shaking hands with north korean officials   demand for apology     signaling that pyongyang is no longer  interested in continuing dialogue with seoul pak accused the  south of having used the envoy exchange talks solely for the  purpose of derailing dprkus highlevel talks  he went on to  strongly insist that the south frankly admit this dark  intention and apologize before the nation  attempting to  place the onus of any breakdown of dialogue on the south pak  further accused seoul of having in effect adopted a declaration  of abandonment of the special envoys exchange a declaration of  an allout confrontation with us and a declaration of war   pyongyang radio on  march depicted pak as making his most  provocative remarks only in response to remarks the south made at  the  march session  according to the radio the south side had  said that should the envoy exchange talks be discontinued there  is no knowing what danger would materialize  to this pak  reportedly replied dont worry about it  what do you think the  south is  if the north suffers damage do you think the south  will go unscathed  pak went on to pledge unspecified immediate  and decisive countermeasures of selfdefense in case some  powers impose sanctions on us or otherwise provoke us  the  radio said pak coupled his pledge with a stern warning not to  take the north korean threats lightly quoting him as saying we  do not know how to engage in idle talk see note   note seouls governmentrun  television on  march  broadcast video recording of even more inflammatory remarks by  pak that were captured by closedcircuit television coverage of  the meeting  in the video pak told his southern counterpart  song yongtae to give a careful consideration to the  consequences of a war and warned that seoul is not far from  here  if war breaks out it will turn into a sea of fire  mr  song it will probably difficult for you too to survive  pyongyang media have not been observed to report on this portion  of paks remarks   moderation of threats     pyongyang subsequently appeared to  backpedal a bit on its threats of war  in a  march statement  issued in the name of the north korean delegation to the inter  korean contacts which again chastised the south for suddenly  assuming what it described as a hardline stance the north made  only passing references to the possibility of war implying  instead that the downfall of the rok government will come from  revolt within the south pyongyang radio  march  the  statement warned the rok to realize that no dictators in the  south had survived committing the antinational act of betraying  fellow countrymen in collusion with outside forces and that  these flunkeyist nationsellers have met a bitter end  north korean motives     pyongyang may calculate that its  brinksmanship will sufficiently split opinions within the south  korean government to make a firm stand against the north  difficult  for the past few months seoul media reporting on  relations with the north has indicated that there are serious  divisions within the seoul government over how to deal with  pyongyang  the latest of these indications came shortly after a   march interkorean meeting  the seoul daily hanguk ilbo on   march cited an unnamed rok government official as saying that  the south and the united states believe that by failing to  agree to the exchange of envoys with seoul pyongyang had  unilaterally invalidated an agreement reached with washington  on resuming highlevel talks in geneva later in the month  apparently alarmed by the possible effects such remarks could  have on the interkorean talks other government officials were  cited the next day by the south korean news agency yonhap as  advocating a different approach  march  one of them was  quoted as saying that seoul should not consider it a violation  of the north koreaus agreement even if north korea refused  the envoy exchange outright  all that would happen he  reportedly said would be that the date of the third round   meeting would be delayed until the envoy  exchange was realized   in addition there has been intermittent south korean reporting  of a division of views between seoul and washington that could  have emboldened pyongyang  most recently for instance yonhap  on  march cited kim taechung a retired opposition leader  and former presidential candidate as lashing out at us  hardliners for allegedly jeopardizing lives of koreans in their  pursuit of confrontation with north korea on the nuclear issue  similarly in an article datelined washington the seoul daily  choson ilbo on  march claimed that the us congress has  concluded that differences between washington and seoul over how  to deal with the north korean nuclear issue are serving as a  stumbling block in the us governments formulation of its  policy toward pyongyangreporting that could have encouraged  pyongyang to reinforce its constant attempt to drive a wedge  between washington and seoul   outlook     pyongyang media treatment of the  march meeting  seems aimed at portraying the north korean leadership as fully  prepared to face the worst case scenario  by declaring  pyongyangs willingness to destroy seoul in a conflict the north  korean leadership may hope to frighten officials in the south  into advocating concessions and thus further aggravate a  perceived division between the united states and south korea   author  yim  questions andor comments please call chief  asia division analysis team    eaghebbelsdj  mar
