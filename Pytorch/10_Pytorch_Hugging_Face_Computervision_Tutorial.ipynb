        "###**History of Transformers, its architecture and how they work**\n",
        "\n",
        "Before talking about hugging face transformer library, lets know about transformers.\n",
        "\n",
        "The `Transformer architecture` was introduced in June 2017. The focus of the original research was on `translation `. This was followed by the introduction of several influential models, including:\n",
        "- June 2018: `GPT`, the `first pretrained Transformer model`, used for fine-tuning on various `NLP tasks` and obtained state-of-the-art results\n",
        "- October 2018: `BERT`, another `large pretrained model`, this one designed to produce better `summaries of sentences`.\n",
        "- February 2019: `GPT-2`, an improved (and bigger) version of GPT that was not immediately publicly released due to ethical concerns\n",
        "- October 2019: `DistilBERT`, a `distilled version of BERT` that is 60% faster, 40% lighter in memory, and still retains 97% of BERT’s performance\n",
        "- October 2019: `BART and T5`, two large pretrained models using the `same architecture as the original Transformer model` (the first to do so)\n",
        "- May 2020, `GPT-3`, an even bigger version of GPT-2 that is able to perform well on a variety of tasks without the need for fine-tuning (called `zero-shot learning`)\n",
        "\n",
        "This list is far from comprehensive, and is just meant to highlight a few of the different kinds of Transformer models. Broadly, they can be grouped into `three categories`:\n",
        "\n",
        "- `GPT-like` (also called `auto-regressive Transformer decoder models`)\n",
        "- `BERT-like` (also called `auto-encoding Transformer models`)\n",
        "- `BART/T5-like` (also called `sequence-to-sequence Transformer models`)\n",
        "\n",
        "We will dive into these families in more depth later on.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Transformers are language models**\n",
        "\n",
        "All the Transformer models mentioned above (GPT, BERT, BART, T5, etc.) have been `trained as language models`. This means they have been `trained on large amounts of raw text in a self-supervised fashion`.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Self-supervised learning** is a type of training in which the objective is automatically computed from the inputs of the model. That means that humans are not needed to label the data!\n",
        "\n",
        "This type of `model develops a statistical understanding of the language it has been trained on`, but it’s `not very useful for specific practical tasks`. Because of this, the general `pretrained model` then goes through a process called `transfer learning` for task specific training. During this process, the `model is fine-tuned in a supervised way` — that is, `using human-annotated labels — on a given task`.\n",
        "\n",
        "An example of a task is `predicting the next word in a sentence having read the n previous words`. This is called `causal language modeling` because the output depends on the past and present inputs, but not the future ones.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another example is `masked language modeling`, in which the `model predicts a masked word in the sentence`.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Transformers are big models**\n",
        "\n",
        "Apart from a few outliers (like DistilBERT), the general strategy to achieve better performance is by increasing the models’ sizes as well as the amount of data they are pretrained on.\n",
        "\n",
        "Unfortunately, training a model, especially a large one, requires a large amount of data. This becomes very costly in terms of time and compute resources. It even translates to environmental impact.\n",
        "\n",
        "And this is showing a project for a (very big) model led by a team consciously trying to reduce the environmental impact of pretraining. The footprint of running lots of trials to get the best hyperparameters would be even higher.\n",
        "\n",
        "Imagine if each time a research team, a student organization, or a company wanted to train a model, it did so from scratch. This would lead to huge, unnecessary global costs!\n",
        "\n",
        "This is why sharing language models is paramount: sharing the trained weights and building on top of already trained weights reduces the overall compute cost and carbon footprint of the community.\n",
        "\n",
        "By the way, you can `evaluate the carbon footprint of your models’ training` through several tools. For example `ML CO2 Impact` https://mlco2.github.io/impact/ or `Code Carbon` https://codecarbon.io/ which is integrated in 🤗 Transformers. To learn more about this, you can read this blog post https://huggingface.co/blog/carbon-emissions-on-the-hub which will show you how to generate an `emissions.csv` file with an estimate of the footprint of your training, as well as the documentation of 🤗 Transformers addressing this topic.https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/model-cards-co2\n",
        "\n",
        "#####**General architecture:**\n",
        "\n",
        "In this section, we’ll go over the general architecture of the Transformer model. Don’t worry if you don’t understand some of the concepts; there are detailed sections later covering each of the components.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Introduction**\n",
        "\n",
        "The model is primarily composed of two blocks:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`Encoder`** (left): The encoder receives an input and builds a representation of it (its features). This means that the model is optimized to acquire understanding from the input.\n",
        "- **`Decoder`** (right): The decoder uses the encoder’s representation (features) along with other inputs to generate a target sequence. This means that the model is optimized for generating outputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Each of these parts can be used independently, depending on the task:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`Encoder-only models`**: Good for tasks that require understanding of the input, such as `sentence classification` and `named entity recognition`.\n",
        "- **`Decoder-only models`**: Good for generative tasks such as `text generation`.\n",
        "- **`Encoder-decoder models` or `sequence-to-sequence models`**: Good for `generative tasks` that require an input, such as `translation` or `summarization`.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will dive into those architectures independently in later sections.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Attention layers**\n",
        "\n",
        "A key feature of Transformer models is that they are built with special layers called `attention layers`. In fact, the title of the paper introducing the Transformer architecture was `“Attention Is All You Need”!` We will explore the details of attention layers later in the course; for now, all you need to know is that this layer will tell the model to pay specific attention to certain words in the sentence you passed it (and more or less ignore the others) when dealing with the representation of each word.\n",
        "\n",
        "To put this into context, consider the `task of translating text from English to French`.\n",
        "\n",
        "Given the input “You like this course”, a translation model will need to also attend to the adjacent word “You” to get the proper translation for the word “like”, because in French the verb “like” is conjugated differently depending on the subject. The rest of the sentence, however, is not useful for the translation of that word. In the same vein, when translating “this” the model will also need to pay attention to the word “course”, because “this” translates differently depending on whether the associated noun is masculine or feminine. Again, the other words in the sentence will not matter for the translation of “this”. With more complex sentences (and more complex grammar rules), the model would need to pay special attention to words that might appear farther away in the sentence to properly translate each word.\n",
        "\n",
        "The same concept applies to any task associated with natural language: `a word by itself has a meaning, but that meaning is deeply affected by the context, which can be any other word (or words) before or after the word being studied`.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now that you have an idea of what attention layers are all about, let’s take a closer look at the Transformer architecture.\n",
        "\n",
        "**The original architecture**\n",
        "\n",
        "The Transformer architecture was originally designed for translation.\n",
        "\n",
        "**During training**, the `encoder` receives inputs (sentences) in a certain language, while the `decoder` receives the same sentences in the desired target language.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the `encoder`, **the attention layers can use all the words in a sentence** (since, as we just saw, the translation of a given word can be dependent on what is after as well as before it in the sentence). The `decoder`, however, **works sequentially and can only pay attention to the words in the sentence that it has already translated** (so, only the words before the word currently being generated).\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, when we have predicted the first three words of the translated target, we give them to the decoder which then uses all the inputs of the encoder to try to predict the fourth word.\n",
        "\n",
        "To speed things up during training (when the model has access to target sentences), the decoder is fed the whole target, but it is not allowed to use future words (if it had access to the word at position 2 when trying to predict the word at position 2, the problem would not be very hard!). For instance, when trying to predict the fourth word, the attention layer will only have access to the words in positions 1 to 3.\n",
        "\n",
        "The original Transformer architecture looked like the encoder on the left and the decoder on the right\n",
        "\n",
        "The first attention layer in a decoder block pays attention to all (past) inputs to the decoder, but the second attention layer uses the output of the encoder. It can thus access the whole input sentence to best predict the current word. This is very useful as different languages can have grammatical rules that put the words in different orders, or some context provided later in the sentence may be helpful to determine the best translation of a given word.\n",
        "\n",
        "The `attention mask` can also be used in the encoder/decoder to prevent the model from paying attention to some special words — for instance, the special padding word used to make all the inputs the same length when batching together sentences.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Architectures vs. checkpoints**\n",
        "\n",
        "As we dive into Transformer models in this course, you’ll see mentions of `architectures` and `checkpoints` as well as `models`. These terms all have slightly different meanings:\n",
        "\n",
        "- `Architecture`: This is the skeleton of the model — the definition of each layer and each operation that happens within the model.\n",
        "- `Checkpoints`: These are the weights that will be loaded in a given architecture.\n",
        "- `Model`: This is an umbrella term that isn’t as precise as “architecture” or “checkpoint”: it can mean both. This course will specify architecture or checkpoint when it matters to reduce ambiguity.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, `BERT` is an `architecture` while `bert-base-cased`, a set of weights trained by the Google team for the first release of BERT, is a `checkpoint`. However, one can say “the BERT model” and “the bert-base-cased model.”\n",
        "\n",
        "**Encoder models**\n",
        "\n",
        "`Encoder models` use only the encoder of a Transformer model. At each stage, the attention layers can access all the words in the initial sentence. These models are often characterized as having `“bi-directional” attention`, and are often called `auto-encoding models`.\n",
        "\n",
        "The `pretraining of these models usually revolves around somehow corrupting a given sentence (for instance, by masking random words in it) and tasking the model with finding or reconstructing the initial sentence`.\n",
        "\n",
        "Encoder models are best `suited for tasks` requiring an `understanding of the full sentence`, such as `sentence classification, named entity recognition (and more generally word classification), and extractive question answering`.\n",

This is a common scenario in real-world projects because annotating text is usually time-consuming and requires domain expertise. For this use case, the zero-shot-classification pipeline is very powerful: it allows you to specify which labels to use for the classification, so you don’t have to rely on the labels of the pretrained model. You’ve already seen how the model can classify a sentence as positive or negative using those two labels — but it can also classify the text using any other set of labels you like."

They are constantly in control, and so far there is nothing a runner will ever be able to control without a very close bond. They will love to run, but they will never be sure of what it is the runner is really like. For the record, this is not all bad – the feeling is there.\\n\\nWhen running a marathon, almost every race is held at a very casual pace, even during the fast times between rounds.\\n\\nRunning is a perfect way to start off your day. When you run your first marathon, be sure you can get the hang of it, that there are still plenty of places to run to relax. You can enjoy life, be active, get away from the work, and enjoy the scenery.\\n\\nWhen you run your first marathon, be sure you can get the hang of it, that there are still plenty of places to run to relax. You can enjoy life, be active, get away from the work, and enjoy the scenery. A successful marathon can be defined as long and long, as you try to spend as much time as possible enjoying one part of yourself before trying to do the other and not spend too much time in it. As you get older, this will feel more and more like an individual sport, a sport that may seem silly at a certain age, but is actually what an adult is meant to be. So, you will be able to push yourself to the maximum, even in the most challenging of times.\\n\\nOne of the most important things to keep in mind when running a marathon is that each of you is connected at the top of your game of life. It is the person you know, who has always had the most fun, who is the coolest at whatever level and the most fun at whatever kind, that decides whether you run.\\n\\nOnce you have decided to run your first marathon, you may start out with some reservations of the best experience of an athlete. And you might not want to say much on those terms. As you go through the final stage of running, you can no longer tell an athlete to stop running or that they will stop working, because their mental health'}]"

The fine-tuning process is thus able to take advantage of knowledge acquired by the initial model during pretraining (for instance, with NLP problems, the pretrained model will have some kind of statistical understanding of the language you are using for your task).\n",

        "The fine-tuning of a language model is cheaper than pretraining in both time and money.\n",

Furthermore, with new models being released on a near-daily basis and each having its own implementation, trying them all out is no easy task.\n",
        "\n",
        "The 🤗 `Transformers library` was created to solve this problem. Its `goal` is to provide a `single API` through which `any Transformer model can be loaded, trained, and saved`.\n",

        "\n",
        "- Ease of use: Downloading, loading, and using a state-of-the-art models for inference can be done in just two lines of code.\n",
        "- Flexibility: At their core, all `models` are simple `PyTorch nn.Module` or `TensorFlow tf.keras.Model classes` and can be handled like any other models in their respective machine learning (ML) frameworks.\n",
        "- Simplicity: Hardly any abstractions are made across the library. The “All in one file” is a core concept: a model’s forward pass is entirely defined in a single file, so that the code itself is understandable and hackable.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "This last feature makes 🤗 Transformers quite different from other ML libraries. The models are not built on modules that are shared across files; instead, each model has its own layers. In addition to making the models more approachable and understandable, this allows you to easily experiment on one model without affecting others.\n",

        "    - It is the other main component of the `pipeline()` function. `Tokenizers` take care of the `first and last processing steps`, handling the conversion from text/image to numerical inputs for the neural network, and the conversion back to text/image when it is needed.\n",
        "- Then, we’ll discuss the `model API` called `AutoModel`\n",
        "    - We’ll dive into the `model and configuration classes`, and show you how to `load a model` and how it `processes numerical inputs` to `output predictions`.\n",

We have `deliberately postponed the padding`, to only `apply it as necessary on each batch` and `avoid having over-long inputs with a lot of padding`.
